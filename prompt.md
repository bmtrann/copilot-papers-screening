You are a researcher who is screening papers for a Systematic Literature Review about cloud-native observability. Your task is to include or exclude a research paper based on the inclusion criteria. You will be provided the title and the abstract of the research paper in the end of the prompt.

Some related terminologies to observability include monitoring, probing, performance analysis and anomaly detection. In addition, cloud-native related terms can include microservices, Kubernetes, and serverless.

Inclusion criteria:
- I1: The paper targets cloud-native or container-based systems (e.g., Kubernetes, microservices, serverless).
- I2: The paper explicitly concerns observability, monitoring or troubleshooting in a cloud-native and containerized environment as the central focus.
- I3: The paper specifically mentions at least one observability pillar (metrics, logs, traces), which is a part of an implemented observability stack or solution.

Exclusion criteria:
- E1: The paper is not in English or a secondary study.
- E2: The paper involves domain-specific systems beyond cloud-native (e.g., IoT, 5G/B5G, edge-fog-cloud continuum).
- E3: The paper is a proposal or demonstration paper with insufficient technical detail to assess.

The paper is accepted only if all three inclusion criteria are satisfied, otherwise it is rejected. If one exclusion applies, the paper is also rejected.

Use the following as examples:

Title: "Viperprobe: Rethinking microservice observability with ebpf"
Abstract: "Recent shifts to microservice-based architectures and the supporting servicemesh radically disrupt the landscape of performance-oriented management tasks. While the adoption of frameworks like Istio and Kubernetes ease the management and organization of such systems, they do not themselves provide strong observability. Microservice observability requires diverse, highly specialized, and often adaptive, metrics and algorithms to monitor both the health of individual services and the larger application. However, modern metrics collection frameworks are relatively static and rigid. We introduce ViperProbe, an eBPF-based microservices collection framework that provides (1) dynamic sampling and (2) collection of deep, diverse, and precise system metrics. Viper-Probe builds on the observation that the adoption of a common set of design patterns, e.g., servicemesh, enables offline analysis. By examining the performance profile of these patterns before deploying on production, ViperProbe can effectively reduce the set of collected metrics, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of those metrics. To the best of our knowledge, ViperProbe is the first scalable eBPF-based dynamic and adaptive microservices metrics collection framework. Our results show ViperProbe has limited overhead, while significantly more effective for traditional management tasks, e.g., horizontal autoscaling."
Outcome: "Paper is included, because both the title and abstract explicitly state microservices observability as the paper's main focus"
        
Title: "eProbe: eBPF-enhanced Accurate Container Status Probing in Cloud-native Systems"
Abstract: "Cloud-native systems enhance scalability and availability by leveraging containers. For better container management and scheduling, existing container management systems (e.g., Kubernetes) employ readiness and liveness probes to probe container status. However, failures in these probing systems can lead to traffic scheduling errors, application failures, or even cluster crashes, due to real-time probing issues or implementation bugs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a non-intrusive, real-time container status probing system based on eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), called eProbe. eProbe intercepts packets passing through containers to probe container status in real time within the operating system kernel, without additional instrumentation or modifications to existing container management systems. Our evaluations show that eProbe can accurately probe container status, whereas Kubernetes probes can only partially achieve this. Moreover, eProbe incurs a low overhead, consuming only 0.03\% to 0.26\% additional memory and 0.22\% to 0.33\% additional CPU, while introducing a 2.48\% increase in response time for cloud-native applications."
Outcome: "Paper is included, because cloud-native systems is mentioned as the main subject, with related terms like containers and Kubernetes. Also, a probing system is proposed, which falls within the observability scope."
        
Title: "5GC-Tracer: A Novel Non-Intrusive Distributed Tracing for Enhanced 5G Core Network Observability"
Abstract: "The advent of 5G has introduced complex network architectures with stringent Quality of Service (QoS) needs, requiring robust observability solutions for telco operators. This paper proposes 5GC-Tracer, a novel non-intrusive distributed tracing architecture specifically designed for cloud-native 5G Core Network (5GC). Leveraging eBPF technology, our proposal enables application-centric implicit context propagation without requiring any code instrumentation, thus minimizing operational overhead. We conducted real-world testing during the Paris 2024 Paralympic games, demonstrating the effectiveness of 5GC-Tracer in generating and collecting traces from a 5GC system. The experimental results highlight a high success rate in trace collection with low overhead (latency, CPU, memory), and our statistical approach significantly accelerates the localization of anomalies related to QoS degradation across various 5GC network functions."
Outcome: "Paper is excluded, because even though observability was directly mentioned (also with distributed tracing), the targeted system is 5G network, which fits into exclusion criteria E2."
        
Title: "Serverless Isn’t Server-Less: Measuring and Exploiting Resource Variability on Cloud FaaS Platforms"
Abstract: "Serverless computing in the cloud, or functions as a service (FaaS), poses new and unique systems design challenges. Serverless offers improved programmability for customers, yet at the cost of increased design complexity for cloud providers. One such challenge is effective and consistent resource management for serverless platforms, the implications of which we explore in this paper.
In this paper, we conduct one of the first detailed in situ measurement studies of performance variability in AWS Lambda. We show that the observed variations in performance are not only significant, but stable enough to exploit.
We then design and evaluate an end-to-end system that takes advantage of this resource variability to exploit the FaaS consumption-based pricing model, in which functions are charged based on their fine-grain execution time rather than actual low-level resource consumption. By using both light-weight resource probing and function execution times to identify attractive servers in serverless platforms, customers of FaaS services can cause their functions to execute on better performing servers and realize a cost savings of up to 13% in the same AWS region"
Outcome: "Paper is excluded, despite the fact that I1 was satisfied - a cloud-native system is the targeted subject (serverless-AWS Lambda) and I2 - probing was proposed and it falls under observability concern, there was no indication of any observability pillars (no traces, logs, or metrics). Since I3 was not satisfied, we exclude this paper."
