  abstract={The benefits provided by microservices architecture in some application scenarios are a motivating factor for organizations to migrate their monoliths to this architecture. Extracting microservices from existing monolithic code bases presents a key challenge in this context, and there is a lack of tools that automate not only the decomposition processes but also the evaluation of the resulting architecture. This work presents a new approach for microservice decomposition that analyzes source code of a monolithic application and, with the combined use of approaches in the literature, suggests parts to be extracted in microservices considering the artifacts: classes, methods and/or history of modifications. The quality of the microservices’ suggestions are assessed, quantitatively, through the silhouette coefficient, a quality metric used in clustering analysis, and the microservice granularity. A tool was developed to automate the process of microservice decomposition for Java repositories. As a result, it was observed that the tool generated clusters with satisfactory results and can be used as an auxiliary instrument by experts during the migration process from monolithic architecture to microservices.},

  abstract={Containerization-based deployment is widely practiced by organiza-tions because of its lightweight and portable nature. The containers are managed by orchestrators, such as Kubernetes, to ensure reli-ability and scalability among other properties. Autoscaling is an essential component for cloud applications and thus Kubernetes’s Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) makes scaling decisions utiliz-ing default metrics, such as CPU and memory utilization or other application-oriented metrics like event loop lag. We consider the above-mentioned metrics as the primary metrics for the autoscaling decision, but explore other metrics, such as HTTP requests and garbage collection related metrics. We consider these additional metrics as secondary metrics that may help better explain the val-ues seen for the primary metrics. We investigated and analyzed the correlation of secondary metrics to the primary metrics and observed patterns indicating significant coupling. Based on these observations, we propose a condition-based autoscaling process using secondary metrics like total garbage collection pause time to improve scaling based on the primary metrics. We demonstrate using a technique of killing pods that exceed thresholds on the sec-ondary metrics instead of scaling in or out as one example of how secondary metrics can be used to improve autoscaling based on the primary metrics. We evaluate our methodology and compare the performance results against the default autoscaling mechanism for various workloads and share results illustrating that it can achieve better results.},

  abstract={Serverless computing in the cloud, or functions as a service (FaaS), poses new and unique systems design challenges. Serverless offers improved programmability for customers, yet at the cost of increased design complexity for cloud providers. One such challenge is effective and consistent resource management for serverless platforms, the implications of which we explore in this paper.In this paper, we conduct one of the first detailed in situ measurement studies of performance variability in AWS Lambda. We show that the observed variations in performance are not only significant, but stable enough to exploit.We then design and evaluate an end-to-end system that takes advantage of this resource variability to exploit the FaaS consumption-based pricing model, in which functions are charged based on their fine-grain execution time rather than actual low-level resource consumption. By using both light-weight resource probing and function execution times to identify attractive servers in serverless platforms, customers of FaaS services can cause their functions to execute on better performing servers and realize a cost savings of up to 13\% in the same AWS region.},

  abstract={The Industry 4.0 initiative is pushing traditional production systems and methodologies through fundamental changes. In traditional industries such as manufacturing, utilities, and infrastructure monitoring, customers are demanding more flexibility and greater efficiency. The software that oversees these systems addresses these demands by adopting novel architectural styles and patterns. Industrial edge systems are gaining momentum because they offer superior data security and better response time to field operations. Microservice style has been adopted from cloud services because it improves development efficiency. This paper presents architecture patterns that cover four phases in the life cycle of industrial software. In the deployment phase, DOWNSHIFTING moves microservices from the cloud to the edge. During runtime, MONITORING CONNECTORS oversee properties of microservices at the edge, such as performance and resource usage. When adaptation is needed, EDGE-TO-CLOUD LOAD BALANCING leverages cloud resources to fulfill performance expectations. When a new microservice version is deployed, TEST PROBE enables testing the microservice at the edge without interfering with ongoing operations.This paper is intended for architects, developers and practitioners who are involved in delivering software in industrial edge environments.},

  abstract={Context: DevOps and microservices are acknowledged to be important new paradigms to tackle contemporary software demands and provide capabilities for rapid and reliable software development. Industrial reports show that they are quickly adopted together in massive software companies. However, because of the technical and organizational requirements, many difficulties against efficient implementation of the both emerge in real software teams. Objectives: This study aims to discover the organization, benefits and issues of software teams using DevOps \&amp; microservices from an immersive perspective. Method: An ethnographic study was carried out in three companies with different business, size, products, customers, and degree of globalization. All the three companies claimed their adoption of DevOps and microservices. Seven months (cumulative) of participant observations and nine interviews with practitioners were conducted to collect the data of software teams related to DevOps and microservices. A cross-company empirical investigation using grounded theory was done by analyzing the archive data. Results: The virtual software teams were organized for adopting DevOps and microservices under the stubborn organizational structure. The adoption of DevOps and microservices brings benefits to rapid delivery, ability improvements and burden reduction, whilst the high cost and lack of practical guidance were emerged. Two major issues of adopting DevOps and microservices in software teams (i.e. fragmentary DevOps and abuse of microservices) were found common in the companies. Moreover, our observations and interviews reflect that in software teams, the relationship between DevOps and microservices is not significant, which differs from the relationship described in the previous studies. Four lessons for practitioners and four implications for researchers were discussed based on our findings. Conclusion: Our findings contribute to the understanding of the organization, benefits and issues of adopting DevOps and microservices from an immersive perspective of software teams.},

  abstract={The issue of passport misuse poses significant threats to both national and international security, as well as the integrity of a country's immigration system. Enhancing the effectiveness of the immigration system to detect and prevent passport misuse is crucial in anticipating as well as mitigating of the potential threats. This study investigates into the implementation of traveler movement extraction to support passport control mechanisms and mitigate the associated risks. The primary objective is to enhance the quality of information to address vulnerabilities in the passport management system and streamline passport verification processes. This approach focuses on the benefits of leveraging the integration of data from diverse microservices such as passport validation, authentication, and real-time border monitoring through web service and utilizing machine learning to extract the valuable data then transforms into insights. By using real-world data sources ensures the accuracy and fidelity of representations. Notably, most informative variables such as duration, frequency, age, gender, country, and category are extracted to inform the analysis. Results indicate that the random forest classifier algorithm outperforms support vector machine and decision tree algorithms in terms of accuracy, achieving rates of 96\% and above across varying dataset thresholds.},

  abstract={Microservices have gained acceptance in software industries as an emerging architectural style for autonomic, scalable, and more reliable computing. Among the critical microservice architecture design decisions is when to adapt the granularity of a microservice architecture by merging/decomposing microservices. No existing work investigates the following question: How can we reason about the trade-off between predicted benefits and cost of pursuing microservice granularity adaptation under uncertainty? To address this question, we provide a novel formulation of the decision problem to pursue granularity adaptation as a real options problem. We propose a novel evaluation process for dynamically evaluating granularity adaptation design decisions under uncertainty. Our process is based on a novel combination of real options and the concept of Bayesian surprises. We show the benefits of our evaluation process by comparing it to four representative industrial microservice runtime monitoring tools, which can be used for retrospective evaluation for granularity adaptation decisions. Our comparison shows that our process can supersede and/or complement these tools. We implement a microservice application—Filmflix—using Amazon Web Service Lambda and use this implementation as a case study to show the unique benefit of our process compared to traditional application of real options analysis.},

  abstract={Microservices have become a popular architectural style for data-driven applications, given their ability to functionally decompose an application into small and autonomous services to achieve scalability, strong isolation, and specialization of database systems to the workloads and data formats of each service. Despite the accelerating industrial adoption of this architectural style, an investigation of the state of the practice and challenges practitioners face regarding data management in microservices is lacking. To bridge this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of representative articles reporting the adoption of microservices, we analyzed a set of popular open-source microservice applications, and we conducted an online survey to cross-validate the findings of the previous steps with the perceptions and experiences of over 120 experienced practitioners and researchers.Through this process, we were able to categorize the state of practice of data management in microservices and observe several foundational challenges that cannot be solved by software engineering practices alone, but rather require system-level support to alleviate the burden imposed on practitioners. We discuss the shortcomings of state-of-the-art database systems regarding microservices and we conclude by devising a set of features for microservice-oriented database systems.},
