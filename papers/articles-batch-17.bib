  abstract={5G is expected to bring the benefits of higher speeds, lower latency and efficient resource management to evermore sectors in the economy, including services using non-3GPP Radio Access Technologies (e.g., WiFi). Such widespread adoption poses important challenges to traditional network management approaches. ETSI delivers specifications enabling the development of scalable, distributed and autonomous management solution by ways of defining Platform as a Service (PaaS) as a new NFV Object. This work implements an envisioned distributed monitoring system that leverages cross-domain PaaS resources to define management components as autonomous Closed Control Loops (CCL) in close proximity to the managed entities (e.g., virtual network functions, end-to-end network slices, 5G Core), minimizing the exchange of raw telemetry among decision-making components. Beyond the increased flexibility and overall efficiency provided by cloud-native models and tools, the presented approach suggests its irruption into the telco cloud enables the implementation of novel management approaches that adapt to services&#x2019; demands, as opposed to the other way around.},

  abstract={The paradigm shift towards the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G) has entailed a transition from a monolithic architecture to a completely disaggregated microservice-based architecture of network functions. This architectural renovation decouples and distributes Containerized Network Functions (CNF), tailored to address the specialized requirements of the Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) deployment. Specifically, Kubernetes has emerged as a pivotal orchestrator for CNF within the context of disaggregated Open RAN. In particular, the deployment of Operator-defined Applications (xApps) for Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) scenarios calls for communication substrates to facilitate the communication and coordination with other RAN components, and consequently, to dial with increased dynamicity and flexibility of 5G deployments. To face these issues, we propose service mesh as a cloud-native technology extending the Kubernetes communication infrastructure. Service mesh fulfills diverse requisites of xApps running in the RAN Intelligent Controller for traffic management, instrumentation, security, and observability, inherently facilitating a zero-trust architecture through the incorporation of sidecar proxies co-located with microservices. Moreover, we evaluate the performances of another emerging paradigm, raising as a lightweight solution that allows a more incremental adoption compared to service mesh, represented by ambient mesh. This paper analyses service and ambient mesh for deploying xApps in a state-of-the-art Near-RT RIC, i.e., the O-RAN SC implementation, evaluating both qualitative and quantitative attributes.},

  abstract={Emerging paradigms such as cloud-edge continuum, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming smart manufacturing systems by enabling intelligent automation, real-time monitoring, and scalable orchestration. These capabilities are particularly critical in additive manufacturing (AM), where latency-sensitive control and predictive maintenance are essential. However, current architectures often require dynamic network programmability, synchronized twin management, and secure telemetry pipelines. This paper presents an SDN-Integrated Cloud-Edge DT Framework tailored for real-time AM monitoring. The framework integrates KubeEdge’s DeviceTwin module for edge-local twin representation, a telemetry agent for structured data streaming, and SDN-controlled Open vSwitch (OVS) for adaptive traffic control. IoT-enabled AM devices, including 3D printers, CNC machines, and robotic arms, interface with the edge node for local state caching, while KubeEdge’s CloudCore aggregates device states for analytics, visualization, and policy enforcement. Experimental validation on a Kubernetes cluster demonstrates sub-100-ms twin synchronization, SDN enforcement under 312 ms, and streaming latency breakdowns across MQTT-Kafka stages. This work establishes a scalable, resilient, and programmable foundation for next-generation, Industry 5.0 manufacturing ecosystems.},

  title={ML-Driven Predictive Autoscaling and Fault Tolerance in Multi-Region Cloud Architectures - 2025 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)},

  abstract={Cloud-native applications deployed across geographically distributed data centers must deliver high availability, low latency, and cost-efficiency, despite unpredictable workloads and region-specific failures. Traditional autoscaling mechanisms, such as those based on threshold policies or reactive triggers, often fall short in dynamic environments due to delayed response times and lack of contextual awareness. Additionally, cloud infrastructure failures-ranging from localized hardware issues to regional outages-can lead to cascading service degradation if not proactively mitigated. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an ML-driven framework that combines predictive autoscaling with intelligent fault detection to enhance system resilience and performance across multi-region cloud deployments. The framework integrates time-series forecasting models (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Prophet, AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), XGBoost) for proactive resource scaling and employs anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest, LSTM-Autoencoder) for early fault identification. The system was evaluated using a mix of real-world datasets (Google Cluster Trace, Alibaba Cluster Data) and synthetic multi-region telemetry collected from federated Kubernetes clusters deployed across AWS, GCP, and Azure. Key performance metrics include Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation rate, prediction accuracy, scaling latency, cost savings, recovery time, and system availability. Results show that the proposed LSTM-based approach reduced SLA violations by over 70 %, cut fault recovery time by 65 %, and achieved up to $\mathbf{1 7. 3 \%}$ cost savings compared to rule-based autoscalers. The framework also demonstrated statistically significant improvements ($\mathbf{p}<0.01$) in all key metrics. This study presents a scalable and modular design for intelligent orchestration, offering a practical blueprint for cloud operators seeking to optimize multi-region workloads using machine learning.},

  abstract={Service Mesh has become essential for modern cloud-native applications by abstracting communication between microservices and providing zero-trust security, observability, and advanced traffic control without requiring code changes. This allows developers to leverage new network capabilities and focus on application logic without managing network complexities. However, the additional layer can significantly impact system performance, latency, and resource consumption, posing challenges for cloud managers and operators. In this work, we investigate the impact of the mTLS protocol-a common security and authentication mechanismon application performance within service meshes. Recognizing that security is a primary motivation for deploying a service mesh, we evaluated the performance overhead introduced by leading service meshes: Istio, Istio Ambient, Linkerd, and Cilium. Our experiments were conducted by testing their performance in service-to-service communications within a Kubernetes cluster. Our experiments reveal significant performance differences (in terms of latency and resource consumption) among the service meshes, rooting from the different architecture of the service mesh, sidecar versus sidecareless, and default extra features hidden in the mTLS implementation. Our results highlight the understanding of the service mesh architecture and its impact on performance.},

  abstract={Modern software development practice has seen a profound shift in architectural design, moving from monolithic approaches to distributed, microservice-based architectures. This allows for much simpler and faster application orchestration and management, especially in cloud-based systems, with the result being that orchestration systems themselves are becoming a key focus of computing research.Orchestration system research addresses many different subject areas, including scheduling, automation, and security. However, the key characteristic that is common throughout is the complex and dynamic nature of distributed, multi-tenant cloud-based microservice systems that must be orchestrated. This complexity has led to many challenges in areas such as inter-service communication, observability, reliability, single cluster to multi-cluster, hybrid environments, and multi-tenancy.The concept of service meshes has been introduced to handle this complexity. In essence, a service mesh is an infrastructure layer built directly into the microservices - or the nodes of orchestrators - as a set of configurable proxies that are responsible for the management, observability, and security of microservices.Service meshes aim to be a full networking solution for microservices; however, they also introduce overhead into a system - this can be significant for low-powered edge devices, as service mesh proxies work in user space and are responsible for processing the incoming and outgoing traffic of each service. To mitigate performance issues caused by these proxies, the industry is pushing the boundaries of monitoring and security to kernel space by employing eBPF for faster and more efficient responses.We propose that the movement towards the use of service meshes as a networking solution for most of the required features by industry - combined with their integration with eBPF - is the next key trend in the evolution of microservices. This paper highlights the challenges of this movement, explores its current state, and discusses future opportunities in the context of microservices.},

  abstract={Thoth is an open-source, Kubernetes-native orchestration framework for deploying post-quantum cryptography (PQC) across heterogeneous, multi-architecture edge clusters. It integrates the NIST-selected CRYSTALS-Dilithium (signatures) and CRYSTALS-Kyber (key encapsulation) to mitigate quantum-era threats. Built on lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) with MQTT messaging, Thoth enables containerized cryptographic services under realistic edge constraints. In prototypes spanning TRK1 RISC-V (signing) and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (verification) nodes, Dilithium signing averaged $6.5 \pm 0.3 \text{ms}$ and verification $4.1 \pm$ 0.2 ms; Kyber encapsulation and decapsulation averaged $6.7 \pm$ 0.3 ms and $4.2 \pm 0.2 \text{ms}$, respectively. End-to-end secure telemetry-including transport and orchestration-remained under 15 ms on average, with the 95th percentile below 50 ms. Verification nodes sustained less than 1.2 W of average power, and pod scaling exhibited near-linear throughput. Emphasizing modularity, observability (Helm, Prometheus, Grafana), and resilience to node/pod failures, Thoth provides quantifiable latency and power guarantees for PQC at the edge. The framework establishes a replicable path toward reliable, resource-aware, and quantum-resilient communication pipelines for secure telemetry, embedded systems, and multi-node edge environments. We provide manifests and scripts to support reproduction.},
