  abstract={Due to complex deployment configurations and dynamic application logics in cloud computing, microservice architectures are widely used to divide cloud applications into multiple independent microservices communicating with each other through APIs that are not associated with languages and platforms. However, a large amount of various microservices make it difficult for operators to predict the performance of microservices and then estimate cloud applications’ capacity. This paper proposes a capacity estimation framework called as Capestor for cloud applications based on a service mesh. Capestor employs a service mesh to place target microservices in isolated containers, simulates workloads, and collect monitoring data related with performance metrics and physical resources. Then, Capestor employs an ElasticNet regression model to correlate resources and performance, and estimates the capacity of each microservice to plan fine-grained flexible expansion. Finally, we evaluate Capestor with a typical microservice based application. The experimental results show that Capestor can estimate the capacity of microservices, and guarantee performance for applications with a low prediction error rate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Linux containers are key enablers for building microservices. The application’s microservices fall broadly under two categories, the core-microservices implementing the business logic and the utility-microservices implementing middleware functionalities. Such functionalities include vulnerability scanning, monitoring, telemetry, etc. Segregating the utility-microservices in separate containers from the core-microservice containers may prevent them from achieving their functionality. This is due to the strong isolation between containers. By diffusing the boundaries between containers we can fuse them together and enable close collaboration. However, this raises several security concerns, especially that the utility-microservices may include vulnerabilities that threaten the entire application. In this paper, we analyze the different techniques to enhance the security of container fusion and present an automated solution based on Kubernetes to configure utility-microservices containers to fuse with core-microservices containers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In Indonesia there is still no monitoring system regarding the condition of cattle in real-time, which is currently used is a microchip RFID Ear Tag which is planted in cattle ears but there is still no communication with the Internet of Things to facilitate cattle farmers in terms of monitoring. The current monitoring is still using human power, this is certainly not effective, especially if you have to monitor the condition of large numbers of cows in a large farm. The instrument of this study there are 3 main parts, namely building a (1) collar device can read body temperature (MLX90615), heart rate sensor(MAX30100), and movement in cattle(GY-25), (2) building a base station for local server management, and (3) web applications to visualize data and analytic health conditions. By collecting data from temperature sensors, heart rate sensors, and inertial measurement unit mounted on the neck of a dairy cow is sent via an internet connection. The collected data is stored and classified using machine learning to produce normal, less normal and abnormal health classification outputs. Moreover, based on the axis sensor produce a graphical output to find out the cows are standing, lying down and eating. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In our daily life, we are increasingly relying on connected systems ranging from smart health care devices to industrial and intelligent transportation systems, as well as smart homes and cities. The unavailability or malfunctioning of these systems could threaten human life, cause environmental damage, and significant financial loss. To prevent such large scale and mission-critical systems from malfunctioning, it is of utmost importance to establish and guaranty reliable connections to attain a dependable networked system. Generally, mesh networking technologies are used for building such systems since mesh networks provide the best performance characteristics regarding fault-tolerance, throughput, resource usage, and service level flexibility. In this paper, we summarize the major challenges in dependable network design, to subsequently present three patterns that approach redundancy on the hardware level, software-defined networking, and cross-cutting concerns like monitoring and service discovery within distributed networked systems. These three patterns should help designers and engineers in choosing the appropriate technologies for building dependable networked systems at all scales. Since dependable network engineering requires a holistic system-wide design and engineering approach, we also present a pattern map guiding to complementary and closely related patterns. System architects and system engineers responsible for building mixed-criticality systems, internet-of-things (IoT), and industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) systems are the target audience of the patterns presented in this paper. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Modern soft X-ray observatories can yield unique insights into time domain astrophysics, and a huge amount of information is stored – and largely unexploited – in data archives. Like a treasure-hunt, the EXTraS project harvested the hitherto unexplored temporal domain information buried in the serendipitous data collected by the European Photon Imaging Camera instrument onboard the ESA XMM-Newton, in 16 years of observations. All results have been released to the scientific community, together with new software analysis tools. This paper presents the architecture of the EXTraS science gateway, that has the goal to provide the software through a web based portal using the EGI Federated Cloud infrastructure. The main focus is on the light software architecture of the portal and on the technological insights for an effective use of the EGI ecosystem. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Software teams today are required to deliver new or updated services frequently, rapidly and independently. Adopting DevOps and Microservices support the rapid service delivery model but leads to pushing code or service infrastructure changes across inter-dependent teams that are not collectively assessed, verified, or notified. In this paper, we propose Harmonia - a continuous service monitoring framework utilizing DevOps and Service Mesh in a complementary manner to improve coordination and change management among independent teams. Harmonia can automatically detect changes in services, including changes that violate performance SLAs and user experience, notify the changes to affected teams, and help them resolve the changes quickly. We applied Harmonia to a standard application in describing Microservice management to assist with an initial understanding and strengths of Harmonia. During the demonstration, we deployed faulty and normal services alternatively and captured changes from Jenkins, Github, Istio, and Kubernetes logs to form an application-centric cohesive view of the change and its impact and notify the affected teams. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In this demonstration, we design and implement a prototype of proof for causal graph building, anomaly detection and root cause analysis of microservice systems. The system comprises two core functionalities: (i) monitoring of systems and services; (ii) Application anomaly detection and root cause analysis. In the first part, the key metrics for the health of a system and an application, are collected by backend and plotted with dynamic charts in the frontend, which can help operators spot the overall system status. In the second part, the system can automatically build a causal graph of the microservice applications, indicating the dependencies between different modules, without instrumenting any source code. When an anomaly of a service instance is detected, it will be highlighted in the graph. A root cause inference function is also applied to analyze the root cause and returns a ranked list of root cause candidates to operators. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
