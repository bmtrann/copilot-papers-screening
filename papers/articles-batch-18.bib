  abstract={The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has enabled the widespread deployment of health monitoring systems. Traditionally, the health monitoring system has been limited by centralized processing and storage in the cloud, leading to latency issues and potential data loss. This paper introduces a smart sleep monitoring system based on edge computing, utilizing microservices architecture and caching techniques. The proposed system employs edge computing to enable data processing closer to the source, reducing latency and improving real-time monitoring capabilities. Caching is employed to reduce database load and optimize random access memory (RAM) usage. This research addresses latency and response time challenges on IoT health monitoring platforms in environments with poor network quality while optimizing database load and resource usage on Jetson Nano as the edge computing device. Using Electrocardiogram (ECG) data as input, the proposed system yields impressive performance metrics. The research results indicate that the proposed system can increase throughput by 26.92 KB/s, reduce response time by 18.8 ms, and decrease latency by 20.86 ms compared to the previous work. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) integration reduces CPU usage by approximately 40% and RAM usage by about 81.24%.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) systems manage microcontroller devices through cloud infrastructure. The modern cloud infrastructure is composed of containerized applications that facilitate internal and external communications. Containers have been used in recent years in a wide range of applications. Containerization of applications and services allows improved modularity for traditional monolithic applications. Combined with IoT, containerization allows efficient allocation, fast execution, and deployment of hardware resources. Docker is the most popular and open-source containerization tool currently used in the field. However, the need to manage these various containers warranted the advent of container orchestration technologies to facilitate the deployment, status monitoring, and scaling of containerized applications. In this study, the container management engine Kubernetes was implemented through the Google Cloud Platform to create an IoT infrastructure composed of containers. The infrastructure used the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. The design of the IoT infrastructure also involved system architecture trade-off analysis of architectural alternatives. The process improves both functional and nonfunctional requirements such as reliability, maintainability, and scalability. The implemented IoT infrastructure in potential applications and reliable for failure scenarios had containers and container orchestration in the Google Kubernetes Engine. The orchestration infrastructure facilitates efficient and effective management of IoT devices.},

  abstract={Microservices make it challenging for operators of cloud-based services to keep higher reliability. To strive for better reliability in service failure detection, some solutions use traditional approaches in their analytics that lead to missing or loss of important characteristics of telemetry data and thus cannot detect the impact of service failure on users. To enhance the detection of the impact of service failure, this paper contributes (i) a hidden service failure scenario based on a realistic use case, and (ii) a deep graph neural networks-based approach for improving service failure analytics. We built deep graph neural networks (DGNNs) to capture the diverse characteristics of telemetry data from observability practice. Our evaluation results, which are built on a digital payment use case, showed that DGNNs improved the detection rate of service failures by more than 30 percentage points compared to the traditional machine learning approaches.},

  abstract={The microservices architecture emerged in response to the increasing scale and complexity of modern software systems, enabling continuous scalability and addressing the challenges of complex monolithic codebases. However, the growing complexity of cloud-native applications also increases the risks of failures. Additionally, design decisions in these applications can manifest as anti-patterns, recurring practices that, while seemingly effective, lead to negative consequences and compromise system quality. This study evaluates the effectiveness of observability in detecting anti-patterns in a microservices-based benchmarking application, contributing to the improvement of the system's architecture and performance by utilizing the OpenTelemetry (OTel) framework. A total of three anti-patterns were detected: Chatty Services, Wobbly Service Interactions, and Cyclic Dependency. Our experiments demonstrated that by resolving the detected anti-patterns, the response time decreased by 9.38%, improving the application's performance and consequently enhancing the user experience.},

  abstract={Modern cloud native applications are highly dependent on service mesh designs, which provide solutions for communication, security, and observability. Architectural decisions for service mesh implementations involve numerous trade-offs that affect system quality. This study analyzes three popular service mesh architectures: Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect, using the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM), we created a utility tree that considers essential quality attributes such as security, maintenance, reliability, and operability. Our analysis identifies important areas of sensitivity where architectural changes have a significant impact on quality attributes, as well as trade-off points where increasing one attribute affects others. Our research identifies common trends in how service mesh designs handle opposing requirements, including proxy deployment, control plane distribution, and configuration management approaches. Our analysis shows that, while all systems prioritize security and observability, they differ dramatically in how they handle the complexity-flexibility trade-off. This analysis offers a systematic approach for software architects to evaluate service mesh designs and understand their trade-offs, leading to better architectural decisions in microservices environments.},

This paper discusses the design of a containerized application monitoring temperature and humidity for IoT devices in three implementations: (1) balenaCloud for edge deployment; (2) Amazon Web Services cloud with EC2 instances; and (3) dedicated Amazon Web Services IoT service. The experiments showed that there are no significant performance differences between Edge and Cloud deployments regarding the resource consumption. However, for fast and almost effortless action, Amazon Web Services IoT is the go-to option when it comes to serverless applications based on Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. For all-in-one automated fleet management balenaCloud seems to be a good tool for IoT developers.},
