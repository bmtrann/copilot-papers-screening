  abstract={Industrial organizations use Energy Management Systems (EMS) to monitor, control, and optimize their energy consumption. Industrial EMS are complex and expensive systems due to the unique requirements of performance, reliability, and interoperability. Moreover, industry is facing challenges with current EMS implementations such as cross-site monitoring of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, integration between energy and production data, and meaningful energy efficiency benchmarking. Additionally, big data has emerged because of recent advances in field instrumentation that led to the generation of large quantities of machine data, with much more detail and higher sampling rates. This created a challenge for real-time analytics. In order to address all these needs and challenges, we propose a cloud-native industrial EMS solution with cloud computing capabilities. Through this innovative approach we expect to generate useful knowledge in a shorter time period, enabling organizations to react quicker to changes of events and detect hidden patterns that compromise efficiency.},

  abstract={Emerging microservices demand flexible low-latency processing of network functions in virtualized environments, e.g., as containerized network functions (CNFs). While ensuring highly responsive low-latency CNF processing, the computing environments should conserve energy to reduce costs. In this systems integration study, we develop and evaluate the novel XDP-Monitoring Energy-Adaptive Network Functions (X-MAN) framework for managing the CPU operational states (P-states) so as to reduce the power consumption while prioritizing low-latency service. Architecturally, X-MAN consists of lightweight traffic monitors that are attached to the virtual network interfaces in the kernel space for per-CNF traffic monitoring and a power manager in user space with a global view of the CNFs on a CPU core. Algorithmically, X-MAN monitors the CPU core utilization via hybrid simple and weighted moving average prediction fed by the traffic monitors and a power management based on step-based CPU core frequency (P-state) adjustments. We evaluate X-MAN through extensive measurements in a real physical testbed operating at up to 10 Gbps. We find that X-MAN incurs significantly shorter and more consistent monitoring latencies for the CPU utilization than a state-of-the-art CPU hardware counter approach. Also, X-MAN achieves more responsive CPU core frequency adjustments and more pronounced reductions of the CPU power consumption than a state-of-the-art code instrumentation approach. We make the X-MAN source code publicly available.},

  abstract={Smart mobility becomes paramount for meeting net-zero targets. However, autonomous, self-driving and electric vehicles require more than ever before an efficient, resilient and trustworthy computational offloading backbone that expands throughout the edge-to-cloud continuum. Utilizing on-demand heterogeneous computational resources for smart mobility is challenging and often cost-ineffective. This paper introduces SMOTEC, a novel open-source testbed for adaptive smart mobility experimentation with edge computing. SMOTEC provides for the first time a modular end-to-end instrumentation for prototyping and optimizing placement of intelligence services on edge devices such as augmented reality and real-time traffic monitoring. SMOTEC supports a plug-and-play Docker container integration of the SUMO simulator for urban mobility, Raspberry Pi edge devices communicating via ZeroMQ and EPOS for an AI-based decentralized load balancing across edge-to-cloud. All components are orchestrated by the K3s lightweight Kubernetes. A proof-of-concept of self-optimized service placements for traffic monitoring from Munich demonstrates in practice the applicability and cost-effectiveness of SMOTEC.},

Our implementation extends the open source tool Galileo by adding support for distributed execution on Kubernetes clusters, additional system monitoring instruments, as well as out-of-the box experiment workloads. We focus on providing tools that run across popular CPU architectures and provide a set of representative workloads, such as edge AI functions. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities in a set of experiments based on use cases commonly found in edge computing systems research. Additionally, we show that the resource usage of our system is minimal and that it can run on resource-constrained devices.},

  abstract={Web services hosted on public cloud platforms are often subjected to performance anomalies. Runtime detection of such anomalies is crucial for operations in cloud data centers. With ever-increasing data center size, complexities in software applications and dynamic traffic workload patterns, automatically detecting performance anomalies is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose RAD, a lightweight runtime anomaly detection technique that does not require application level instrumentation and can be easily implemented for detecting anomalies in multi-tier cloud-based Web services. In particular, we focus on anomalies that are difficult to detect by simply monitoring system level metrics alone, such as anomalies that are caused by contention from within a service and also those caused by shared resource contention by other services running on the cloud. RAD continuously monitors service resource metrics and uses a queuing network model to detect performance anomalies at runtime. Additionally, RAD uses historical data and implements a statistical methodology to diagnose the root cause of an anomaly. We evaluate RAD on a private cloud and also on the EC2 public cloud platform to show that RAD incurs extremely low levels of performance overhead on the service and is effective for detecting anomalies in both multi-tier monolithic services and microservices.},

  abstract={Serverless computing has become a fact of life on modern clouds. A serverless function may process sensitive data from clients. Protecting such a function against untrusted clouds using hardware enclave is attractive for user privacy. In this work, we run existing serverless applications in SGX enclave, and observe that the performance degradation can be as high as 5.6X to even 422.6X. Our investigation identifies these slowdowns are related to architectural features, mainly from page-wise enclave initialization. Leveraging insights from our overhead analysis, we revisit SGX hardware design and make minimal modification to its enclave model. We extend SGX with a new primitive---region-wise plugin enclaves that can be mapped into existing enclaves to reuse attested common states amongst functions. By remapping plugin enclaves, an enclave allows in-situ processing to avoid expensive data movement in a function chain. Experiments show that our design reduces the enclave function latency by 94.74--99.57\%, and boosts the autoscaling throughput by 19-179X.},

  abstract={In modern software systems, Microservice Architecture (MSA) has gained popularity over monolithic design by providing the ability for flexible and independently upgradable services. Although there are considerable benefits that MSA provides, as new microservices are introduced into these MSA-based systems, they can become increasingly complex and hard to understand. Architectural languages are a potential solution to this problem because they can provide a comprehensive overview of system's architecture as it changes. In this paper, the authors conduct a systematic mapping study to identify the architectural languages discussed in academia. In particular, the authors observe the architectural languages that have the capability of representing MSA-based systems. Through the use of a detailed query in 4 reliable indexers, a collection of 402 papers were filtered down to a small set of 19 relevant papers. This filtration was done based on a research paper inclusion criteria and a language inclusion criteria. With these papers, a total of 12 architectural languages were investigated for the representation of MSA-based systems.},

  abstract={Microservice-based systems have emerged as an effective architecture for countless industry applications. They provide applications as small, independent, and modular services. With the increasing interest in such systems, it is important to tackle challenges related to their quality assurance. However, to advance research in this area, systems are required to evaluate new approaches and tools. In this paper, we perform a systematic literature search for systems used in research for testing and monitoring microservice-based systems to aid future research. We provide an overview of the found studies and the systems used in their evaluation. We compose a list of publicly available systems and their characteristics, like size, available tests, and technologies used. Finally, we investigated the context in which these systems were used to provide insights in their usage and additional data that is available for them.},
