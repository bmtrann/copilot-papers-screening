  abstract={The widespread adoption of containerized infrastructure and Kubernetes orchestration has introduced new vectors for security threats, particularly in the form of unauthorized resource consumption such as cryptojacking. Traditional detection and prevention strategies, including signature-based monitoring and static policy enforcement, often fail to address dynamic or evolving attack patterns. This study introduces a multi-layered runtime defense framework that integrates system call anomaly detection using Falco, policy enforcement through Kyverno, and behavioral analytics via telemetry data collection. The framework is designed to enhance detection, mitigation, and response capabilities against cryptocurrency mining activities in Kubernetes clusters. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through controlled emulation of cryptomining attacks, enabling evaluation of detection latency, policy response, and system performance.},

  abstract={The majority of applications nowadays reside in the cloud, allowing users to utilize remote resources and services providing flexibility and low cost access to a large range of applications. An inherent part of cloud operations is monitoring, which allows to survey the performance of the consumed applications and take corrective actions whenever a performance drift is noticed. Nonetheless, cloud telemetry tools are only concentrating in monitoring the data center infrastructure that hosts the cloud native applications, failing to assure the performance in a user to cloud continuum fashion. Hence, in this paper, we propose a two-way monitoring approach, leveraging Software Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) capabilities. Specifically, by installing monitoring probes in both the WAN and cloud infrastructures, cloud vendors can monitor user traffic and provide application performance view on network links, in order to take Informed Network Routing (INR) decisions. Our results, using Microsoft 365 (M365) as a proof of concept, clearly show the benefit of the two-way monitoring approach in various traffic congestion scenarios. Additionally, since this is a first-of-its-kind solution, we also propose the foundations of a new communication protocol that can leverage the proposed two-way monitoring approach in larger scale and multi-vendor Software as a Service (SaaS) environments.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) systems represent a powerful solution for reestablishing connectivity in emergency scenarios where terrestrial infrastructure is damaged or overloaded. However, ensuring service continuity under UAV mobility and resource constraints poses significant orchestration challenges. This paper presents a mobility-aware orchestration framework tailored for UAV-enabled IoT networks in such critical contexts. Leveraging Kubernetes for service orchestration and Prometheus for telemetry monitoring, we design and implement a modular architecture that dynamically reallocates containerized services across mobile UAV nodes in real time. Our framework is validated through physical testbed experiments on Raspberry Pi-equipped UAVs, where container migration is triggered by geographic constraints and monitored across varying pod workloads and link conditions. Results demonstrate robust adaptability, sub-second recovery under favorable link quality, and a scalable orchestration strategy for mission-critical operations. This work advances the practical deployment of orchestrated UAV swarms, bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and real-world mobility-aware computing.},

  abstract={Microservices Architectures (MSA) have found large adoption in companies delivering online services, often in conjunction with agile development practices. Microservices are distributed, independent and polyglot entities – all features favouring black-box testing. However, for real-scale MSA, a pure black-box strategy may not be able to exercise the system to properly cover the interactions involving internal microservices.We propose a grey-box strategy (MACROHIVE) for automated testing and monitoring of (internal) microservices interactions. It uses combinatorial testing to generate valid and invalid tests from microservices specification. Tests execution and monitoring are automated by a service mesh infrastructure. MACROHIVE runs the tests and traces the interactions among microservices, to report about internal coverage and failing behaviour.MACROHIVE is experimented on TrainTicket, an open-source MSA benchmark. It performs comparably to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of edge-level coverage, but exposes internal failures undetected by black-box testing, gives detailed internal coverage information, and requires fewer tests.},

  title={Informed and Assessable Observability Design Decisions in Cloud-Native Microservice Applications - 2024 IEEE 21st International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA)},

  abstract={Observability is important to ensure the reliability of microservice applications. These applications are often prone to failures, since they have many independent services deployed on heterogeneous environments. When employed “correctly”, observability can help developers identify and troubleshoot faults quickly. However, instrumenting and configuring the observability of a microservice application is not trivial but tool-dependent and tied to costs. Architects need to understand observability-related trade-offs in order to weigh between different observability design alternatives. Still, these architectural design decisions are not supported by systematic methods and typically just rely on “professional intuition”. In this paper, we argue for a systematic method to arrive at informed and continuously assessable observability design decisions. Specifically, we focus on fault observability of cloud-native microservice applications, and turn this into a testable and quantifiable property. Towards our goal, we first model the scale and scope of observability design decisions across the cloud-native stack. Then, we propose observability metrics which can be determined for any microservice application through so-called observability experiments. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of our experiment tool Oxn. Oxn is able to inject arbitrary faults into an application, similar to Chaos Engineering, but also possesses the unique capability to modify the observability configuration, allowing for the assessment of design decisions that were previously left unexplored. We demonstrate our approach using a popular open source microservice application and show the trade-offs involved in different observability design decisions.},

  abstract={With the development of cloud computing, serverless-based applications are becoming increasingly prevalent. In the serverless paradigm, cloud service providers handle all server-related management, allowing developers to focus solely on business logic and code. However, the lack of server management access for developers results in poor observability of serverless-based applications, making it challenging to perform end-to-end code analysis and vulnerability discovery in serverless scenarios. This, in turn, introduces security challenges to software production. To address the challenge of poor observability of serverless-based applications, this paper proposes a fully-extended call graph construction scheme to enhance the observability of serverless-based applications. The scheme consists of three modules: an application configuration file input module, a service dependency graph composition module, and a state machine workflow graph embedding module. The proposed scheme introduces new node types to increase the information content, ultimately producing a fully-extended call graph that can be used for application flow analysis, demonstrating deeper interconnectivity in serverless mode. Finally, this paper validates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through experiments. The experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme reduces the operational complexity compared to the static call graph construction scheme. Additionally, the proposed scheme does not rely on intrusive monitoring techniques such as code instrumentation or agent-based embedding, thus avoiding the high compile-time and runtime overhead associated with intrusive monitoring.},
