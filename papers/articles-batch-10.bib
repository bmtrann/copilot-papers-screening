  abstract={The increasing availability of User-Generated Content during large-scale events is transforming spectators into active co-creators of live narratives while simultaneously introducing challenges in managing heterogeneous sources, ensuring content quality, and orchestrating distributed infrastructures. A trial was conducted to evaluate automated orchestration, media enrichment, and real-time quality assessment in a live sporting scenario. A key innovation of this work is the use of a cloud-native architecture based on Kubernetes, enabling dynamic and scalable integration of smartphone streams and remote production tools into a unified workflow. The system also included advanced cognitive services, such as a Video Quality Probe for estimating perceived visual quality and an AI Engine based on YOLO models for detection and recognition of runners and bib numbers. Together, these components enable a fully automated workflow for live production, combining real-time analysis and quality monitoring, capabilities that previously required manual or offline processing. The results demonstrated consistently high Mean Opinion Score (MOS) values above 3 72.92\% of the time, confirming acceptable perceived quality under real network conditions, while the AI Engine achieved strong performance with a Precision of 93.6\% and Recall of 80.4\%.},

  abstract={Microservice enables agility in modern cloud-native applications but introduces challenges in fault troubleshooting due to its complex service coordination and cooperation. To tackle these challenges, distributed tracing has emerged for end-to-end request tracing and system understanding. However, existing tracing solutions often suffer from code instrumentation, trace loss and inaccuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ZeroTracer, an in-kernel online distributed tracing system equipped with an eBPF-based (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) trace generator. ZeroTracer tailors for tracking HTTP requests due to its popularity in microservice systems. In our evaluations, ZeroTracer achieves remarkable trace accuracy (i.e., over 91\% ) and maintains stable performance under different workload concurrency. Moreover, ZeroTracer outperforms other non-invasive approaches which fail to reconcile accurate request causality. Notably, ZeroTracer effectively tracks end-to-end requests in multi-threaded microservice applications, which is absent in existing invasive distributed tracing systems with third-party library instrumentation. Moreover, ZeroTracer introduces a negligible overhead, with latency increasing by only 0.5\% -1.2\% and a modest 3\% -5.8\% increase in CPU and memory consumption.},

  abstract={Integrating computation resources with networking technologies is an hot research topic targeting the optimization of containers deployment on a set of host machines interconnected by a network infrastructure. Particularly, next generation edge nodes will offer significant advantages leveraging on integrated computation resources and networking awareness, enabling configurable, granular and monitorable quality of service to different micro-services, applications and tenants, especially in terms of bounded end-to-end latency. In this regard, SDN is a key technology enabling network telemetry and traffic switching with the granularity of the single traffic flow. However, currently available solutions are based on legacy SDN techniques, not enabling the matching of tunneled traffic, and thus require a tricky integration inside the hosts where containers are deployed. This work considers Kubernetes clusters deployed on next generation edge micro data center platforms and proposes an innovative SDN solution exploiting the P4 technology to gain visibility inside tunnelled traffic exchanged among pods. This way, the integration is achieved at the control plane level through the communication between Kubernetes and the SDN controller. The proposed solution is experimentally validated including a comprehensive framework enabling effective traffic switching and in-band telemetry at pod level. The major paper contributions consist in the design and the development of: (i) the networking applications at SDN control plane level; (ii) the P4 switch pipeline at the data plane level; (iii) the monitoring system used to collect, aggregate and elaborate the telemetry data.},

  journal={FUTURE INTERNET},
  volume={14},
  number={10},
  author={Kratzke, Nane},
  abstract={Background: Cloud-native software systems often have a much more decentralized structure and many independently deployable and (horizontally) scalable components, making it more complicated to create a shared and consolidated picture of the overall decentralized system state. Today, observability is often understood as a triad of collecting and processing metrics, distributed tracing data, and logging. The result is often a complex observability system composed of three stovepipes whose data are difficult to correlate. Objective: This study analyzes whether these three historically emerged observability stovepipes of logs, metrics and distributed traces could be handled in a more integrated way and with a more straightforward instrumentation approach. Method: This study applied an action research methodology used mainly in industry-academia collaboration and common in software engineering. The research design utilized iterative action research cycles, including one long-term use case. Results: This study presents a unified logging library for Python and a unified logging architecture that uses the structured logging approach. The evaluation shows that several thousand events per minute are easily processable. Conclusions: The results indicate that a unification of the current observability triad is possible without the necessity to develop utterly new toolchains.},

  abstract={To support the pervasive digital evolution, optical network infrastructures must be able to quickly and effectively adapt to changes arising from traffic dynamicity or external factors such as faults and attacks. Network automation is crucial for enabling dynamic, scalable, resource-efficient, and trustworthy network operations. Novel telemetry solutions enable optical network management systems to obtain fine-grained monitoring data from devices and channels as the first step toward the near-real-time diagnosis of anomalies such as security threats and soft failures. However, the collection of large amounts of data creates a scalability challenge related to processing the data within the desired monitoring cycle regardless of the number of optical services being analyzed. This paper proposes a module that leverages the cloud native software deployment approach to achieve near-real-time machine learning (ML)-assisted diagnosis of optical channels. The results obtained over an emulated physical-layer security scenario demonstrate that the architecture successfully scales the necessary components according to the computational load and consistently achieves the desired monitoring cycle duration over a varying number of monitored optical channels.},

  abstract={Despite modern advances in automation and managed services, many end users of cloud services remain concerned about the lack of visibility into their operational environments. The underlying principles of existing approaches employed to aid users gain visibility into their runtimes do not apply to today's dynamic cloud environment where virtual machines and containers operate as processes of the cloud operating system. We present near field monitoring (NFM), a cloud-native framework for monitoring cloud systems and providing operational analytics services. With NFM, we employ cloud, virtualization, and containerization abstractions to provide extensive visibility into running entities in the cloud, in a touchless manner, i.e., without modifying, instrumenting, or accessing within the end-user context. Operating outside the context of the target systems enables always-on monitoring independent of their health. Using an NFM implementation on OpenStack, we demonstrate the capabilities of NFM, as well as its monitoring accuracy and efficiency. NFM is practical and general, supporting more than 1,000 different system distributions, allowing instantaneous monitoring as soon as a guest system becomes hosted on the cloud, without any setup prerequisites or enforced cooperation.},

  abstract={Microservice deployment methods in edge-native computing environments hold great potential for minimizing user application response time. However, most existing studies overlook the communication overhead between microservices and controllers, as well as the impact of microservice pull time on user response time. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-controller service mesh architecture to reduce data transfer overhead between microservices and controllers. Furthermore, we formulate the microservice deployment problem as an optimization problem aimed at minimizing both system communication overhead and microservice deployment cost. To achieve this, we introduce a novel RIME optimization algorithm and enhanced Adaptive Crested Porcupine Optimizer (RIME-ACPO) algorithm that optimizes microservice placement decisions. Notably, this algorithm incorporates a real-time resource monitoring-based load balancing algorithm, dynamically adjusting microservice deployment according to edge server resource utilization to enhance the execution performance of user applications. Finally, extensive simulation experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other algorithms, our algorithm significantly improves user response time, optimizes resource utilization, and reduces the total cost.},

  abstract={The microservice architecture has been commonly adopted by large scale software systems exemplified by a wide range of online services. Service monitoring through anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) is crucial for these microservice systems to provide stable and continued services. However, compared with monolithic systems, software systems based on the layered microservice architecture are inherently complex and commonly involve entities at different levels of granularity. Therefore, for effective service monitoring, these systems have a special requirement of multi-granular RCA. Furthermore, as a large proportion of anomalies in microservice systems pertain to problematic code, to timely troubleshoot these anomalies, these systems have another special requirement of RCA at the finest code-level. Microservice systems rely on telemetry data to perform service monitoring and RCA of service anomalies. The majority of existing RCA approaches are only based on a single type of telemetry data and as a result can only support uni-granular RCA at either application-level or service-level. Although there are attempts to combine metric and tracing data in RCA, their objective is to improve RCA's efficiency or accuracy rather than to support multi-granular RCA. In this article, we propose a new RCA solution TrinityRCL that is able to localize the root causes of anomalies at multiple levels of granularity including application-level, service-level, host-level, and metric-level, with the unique capability of code-level localization by harnessing all three types of telemetry data to construct a causal graph representing the intricate, dynamic, and nondeterministic relationships among the various entities related to the anomalies. By implementing and deploying TrinityRCL in a real production environment, we evaluate TrinityRCL against two baseline methods and the results show that TrinityRCL has a significant performance advantage in terms of accuracy at the same level of granularity with comparable efficiency and is particularly effective to support large-scale systems with massive telemetry data.},
