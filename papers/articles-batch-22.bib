  abstract={Digital transformation in financial services, fueled by real-time payments, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) offerings, and open banking APIs, intensifies the imperative for credit platforms to achieve rapid and secure feature releases while adhering to stringent regulatory demands. However, empirical evidence detailing the adoption of microservices within regulated fintech remains limited. This paper presents an in-depth single-organization case study of a medium-sized consumer finance lender that migrated its monolithic Node/Spring architecture to domain-driven microservices between Q4 2023 and Q3 2024. Employing a mixed-methods approach—analyzing Application Performance Monitoring (APM) traces, Git/GitHub workflow metrics, and conducting 12 semi-structured interviews with engineers—we evaluated the migration outcomes and the strategic application of four classical design patterns: Factory, Observer, Repository, and Saga. Key findings reveal significant improvements: median deployment lead time decreased by 85% (from 3 days to 45 minutes), 95th percentile API latency reduced by 77% (from 480 ms to 110 ms), and throughput capacity increased 4.3-fold to 10,000 requests per second. The Factory pattern eliminated 40% of decision-tree branching, the Observer pattern enabled a 5× horizontal fan-out for parallel processing, while the Repository pattern introduced a manageable 7 ms latency overhead, cacheable in 92% of calls. The study highlights a crucial trade-off between a ≈30% increase in operational observability costs and the enhanced agility required for near real-time regulatory adjustments. Ultimately, this research provides a pattern-centric blueprint for similar migrations and identifies key areas for future investigation, including zero-trust service meshes, AI-driven credit scoring, and formal verification of cross-service sagas.},

  abstract={Microservices have become a prevalent architectural style over the past decade, emphasizing the modular and dynamic nature of heterogeneous and distributed units that communicate with each other. Moreover, they promote polyglot persistence, meaning that each microservice is responsible for managing its own database(s), often with heterogeneous technologies. One of the downsides is the increase of the number and diversity of data access endpoints and exchanges. Additionally, the decomposition introduces implicit dependencies that affect code and data understanding and co-evolution. Maintaining a comprehensive high-level view of this kind of architecture is challenging, yet essential for software evolution tasks. Previous works have already proposed holistic representations and visualizations of data access in microservices. However, these are mainly based on structural and fixed snapshots, neglecting the dynamic perspective.We present an approach to enhance static visualizations. First, we record data-access-centered execution traces in microservices architectures through a static analysis-based refinement of dynamic instrumentation. Then, we replay scenarios over an existing static treemap, animating the sequence of data accesses and highlighting hotspots in the codebase through time. Our contribution, the animated heat treemap, helps developers to understand how data management operates inside microservices. We validated our approach on Overleaf, a popular online collaborative LATEX authoring platform, with a real-world scenario. We discuss the results obtained and provide insights and reflections.},

  abstract={Breaking large software systems into smaller functionally interconnected components is a trend on the rise. This architectural style, known as “microservices”, simplifies development, deployment and management at the expense of complexity and observability. In fact, in large scale systems, it is particularly difficult to determine the set of microservices responsible for delaying a client's request, when one module impacts several other microservices in a cascading effect. Components cannot be analyzed in isolation, and without instrumenting their source code extensively, it is difficult to find the bottlenecks and trace their root causes. To mitigate this problem, we propose a much simpler approach: log gateway activity, to register all calls to and between microservices, as well as their responses, thus enabling the extraction of topology and performance metrics, without changing source code. For validation, we implemented the proposed platform, with a microservices-based application that we observe under load. Our results show that we can extract relevant performance information with a negligible effort, even in legacy systems, where instrumenting modules may be a very expensive task.},

  abstract={The advent of 5G has introduced complex network architectures with stringent Quality of Service (QoS) needs, requiring robust observability solutions for telco operators. This paper proposes 5GC-Tracer, a novel non-intrusive distributed tracing architecture specifically designed for cloud-native 5G Core Network (5GC). Leveraging eBPF technology, our proposal enables application-centric implicit context propagation without requiring any code instrumentation, thus minimizing operational overhead. We conducted real-world testing during the Paris 2024 Paralympic games, demonstrating the effectiveness of 5GC-Tracer in generating and collecting traces from a 5GC system. The experimental results highlight a high success rate in trace collection with low overhead (latency, CPU, memory), and our statistical approach significantly accelerates the localization of anomalies related to QoS degradation across various 5GC network functions.},

  abstract={As blockchain technologies are increasingly adopted in enterprise and research domains, the need for secure, scalable, and performance-transparent node infrastructure has become critical. While self-hosted Ethereum nodes offer operational control, they often lack elasticity and require complex maintenance. This paper presents a hybrid, service-oriented architecture for deploying and monitoring Ethereum full nodes using Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB), integrated with EC2-based observability, IAM-enforced security policies, and reproducible automation via the AWS Cloud Development Kit. Our architecture supports end-to-end observability through custom EC2 scripts leveraging Web3.py and JSON-RPC, collecting over 1,000 real-time data points—including gas utilization, transaction inclusion latency, and mempool dynamics. These metrics are visualized and monitored through AWS CloudWatch, enabling service-level performance tracking and anomaly detection. This cloud-native framework restores low-level observability lost in managed environments while maintaining the operational simplicity of managed services. By bridging the simplicity of AMB with the transparency required for protocol research and enterprise monitoring, this work delivers one of the first reproducible, performance-instrumented Ethereum deployments on AMB. The proposed hybrid architecture enables secure, observable, and reproducible Ethereum node operations in cloud environments, suitable for both research and production use.},

  abstract={The adoption of the microservice architectural style is proving very advantageous as it facilitates the creation of distributed, scalable and available solutions, favoring the use of cloud and container infrastructures. For these and other advantages has been widely adopted by large global companies in the application development market like Uber, Netflix, Amazon, SoundCloud, and many others. If on the one hand the use of microservices provides scalability, maintainability and availability, on the other hand it requires a high degree of observability of operations. However, traditional monitoring tools are incomplete to deal with this distributed scenario. Thus, this paper proposes the use of an integrated and scalable service mesh-based architecture to be incorporated into a health platform project whose main objective is to increase the observability capabilities of the system, allowing the contextualized monitoring of transactions between the various microservices.},

  abstract={Service meshes are becoming pivotal software frameworks for managing communication among microservices in distributed applications. Each microservice in a service mesh is paired with an L7 sidecar proxy, which intercepts incoming and outgoing requests to provide enhanced observability, traffic management, and security. These sidecar proxies use application-level load balancing policies to route outgoing requests to available replicas of destination microservices. A widely adopted policy is the Least Outstanding Request (LOR), which directs requests to the replica with the fewest outstanding requests. While LOR effectively reduces latency in applications with a small number of replicas, our comprehensive investigation– combining analytical, simulation, and experimental methods– uncovers a novel and critical issue for large-scale microservice applications: the performance of LOR significantly degrades as the number of microservice replicas increases, eventually converging to the performance of a random load balancing policy. To recover LOR performance at scale, we propose an opensource solution named Proxy-Service, tailored for microservice applications where load balancing incurs significantly lower resource demands than microservice execution. The core idea is to consolidate load balancing decisions per microservice into one or a few reverse proxies, transparently injected into the application.},
