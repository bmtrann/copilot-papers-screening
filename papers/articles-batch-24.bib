  abstract={This paper presents the IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) Gateway, an intermediary service framework designed to address the core challenges of industrial information integration. By creating a seamless bridge between OT (Operational Technology) systems and modern IT (Information Technology) infrastructures, our work provides a practical solution that directly contributes to the field of industrial information integration. The framework simplifies the integration process for information service providers by facilitating seamless communication and data exchange between diverse PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) devices and enterprise information systems. It achieves this by leveraging a combination of Operational Technology (OT) protocols, such as OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) and Modbus, and Information Technology (IT) standards, including MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The proposed IIoT Gateway enables application engineers to utilize standardized protocols and JSON for control commands, data exchange, and real-time monitoring via webhook technology, significantly reducing development complexity and project timelines. The framework was initially implemented using a monolithic architecture and later refactored into a microservice-based architecture, leveraging Spring Cloud and Nacos to enhance scalability and flexibility. The IIoT Gateway has been successfully integrated and validated in a real-world industrial environment at Everising Machine Co., demonstrating high availability and stability. This work provides a practical blueprint for OT/IT convergence, with future research directions focused on visualized data mapping, AI-enabled automation, enhanced cybersecurity and performance optimization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Microservice architectures have become the standard for developing scalable distributed systems that offer significant benefits in managing the integration and evolution of complex applications. However, they face challenges in effectively diagnosing and resolving performance and reliability issues. Traditional centralized telemetry models and cloud-based monitoring platforms often require complex or costly configurations and are not optimized for RESTful microservices. In fact, although the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) has become a key standard for describing microservice APIs, existing telemetry tools do not leverage this information to enhance service analysis and diagnostics. This paper introduces a lightweight and distributed approach to telemetry that uses OAS-based API information, offering an automated, configuration-free system that enables developers and operations teams to perform root cause analysis more efficiently. Moreover, we propose a plugin system to incorporate intelligent behavior into the telemetry system, such as an adaptive proactive alert mechanism when response-time anomalies are detected. By incorporating this extensibility mechanism, the framework paves the way to address issues such as energy consumption and performance, allowing the system to dynamically adjust its monitoring activities to optimize resource usage and minimize the carbon footprint of microservice deployment and execution. This adaptability reduces operational overhead and supports sustainable computing practices. To validate our approach, we present a proof-of-concept in the form of a ready-to-use package for the NodeJS ecosystem, demonstrating that this distributed telemetry model can operate with minimal impact on system performance and resource usage, proving its effectiveness to support more robust and sustainable IT systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Root cause analysis (RCA) for microservice systems has gained significant attention in recent years. However, there is still no standard benchmark that includes large-scale datasets and supports comprehensive evaluation environments. In this paper, we introduce RCAEval, an open-source benchmark that provides datasets and an evaluation environment for RCA in microservice systems. First, we introduce three comprehensive datasets comprising 735 failure cases collected from three microservice systems, covering various fault types observed in real-world failures. Second, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes fifteen reproducible baselines covering a wide range of RCA approaches, with the ability to evaluate both coarse-grained and fine-grained RCA. We hope that this ready-to-use benchmark will enable researchers and practitioners to conduct extensive analysis and pave the way for robust new solutions for RCA of microservice systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Change point detection (CPD) is crucial for identifying abrupt shifts in time series data across various domains. In microservice architectures, where components operate at high velocity and scale, monitoring efficiency becomes particularly critical for maintaining system reliability while minimizing over-head. Efficient change point detection allows for timely root cause analysis, dynamic resource allocation, and targeted instance restarts, interventions that can prevent cascading failures across interconnected services. This paper presents a novel approach called MMR-FFT CPD that transforms high-dimensional mi-croservice telemetry data into a one-dimensional kernel-based representation through Maximum Margin Regression (MMR). The resulting 1D time series is then processed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for efficient temporal pattern forecasting, which enables prediction of expected future values. By computing the correlation between these FFT-based predictions and the actual observed values, our method can identify deviations that indicate potential change points in microservice behavior. By tracking only these compact representations rather than raw metrics, our method dramatically reduces computational overhead and network traffic in distributed monitoring scenarios. We evaluated MMR-FFT CPD against multiple state-of-the-art algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that with a 1D data transfer to the monitoring entity, we can maintain competitive detection accuracy, which is advantageous, particularly for high-dimensional data streams typical in modern distributed systems. The results provide valuable insights for implementing efficient, low-overhead monitoring in microservice environments with varying computational and network constraints, enabling more resnonsive and resilient microservice architectures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the accelerated pace of digitalization, computing power has emerged as a key infrastructure supporting the development of the digital economy and has become a new engine driving economic and social progress. To promote the deep integration of computing power and network resources while providing users with a ubiquitous and consistent computing service experience, the concept of the computing power network has emerged. However, how to meet the requirements of the computing power network for coordinated planning and efficient adaptation of computing and network resources has become a current research focus. Therefore, this paper designs and implements a Service Mesh-based computing power open interconnection system to promote large-scale interconnectivity and network computing integration. The system supports automatic registration, discovery, and updating of computing power services, offering a transparent and efficient invocation mechanism.

  abstract={Machine Learning and related methods of Artificial Intelligence have come a long way from being research-oriented topics and these capabilities are differentiators in a business system. At a scale and diversity of the 5V’s of modern data scenarios, these algorithms often sit at a very critical juncture of the ML-operations pipeline and have to be continuously trained and validated through a continuous flow of new data. One aspect of efficiently using such algorithms is to explain them to various concerned stakeholders, both human and other downstream applications. Explainability is extremely important for auditing and compliance purposes as well. Algorithms such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) are popular in dealing with explanations for a black box model. While a machine learning algorithm is often deployed as a container in an orchestrated framework, adding an explainable part increases the complexity of the architecture. Often the implementation and deployment logic of such explainable algorithms are model agnostics (like LIME and SHAP). In this paper, we have identified this opportunity and proposed an Ambassador-based Side Car (AbSC) pattern to deploy these models uniformly across varied machine learning deployments. The proposed architecture will show how to use the Ambassador-based Side Car pattern to use an explainability algorithm like LIME as a side car proxy alongside the main machine learning container to be used to explain the output of the algorithm on demand. Security and compliance will be emphasized as these two nonfunctional requirements are amongst the primary reasons why explainability is required for machine learning algorithms. The pattern will help to enhance the reusability and modularity of machine learning deployment architectures by separating explanations from actual model working. This will increase the observability of the overall architecture and contribute towards a more robust microservices-oriented architecture. A comparison with an existing model explainability architecture tightly coupled with the primary model deployment is done, and telemetry is seen to improve. To manage the scope of this paper and focus on building the architecture rather than expanding to cover more surface area, we will limit our discussions to LIME explainability and consider model-specific explanations like Layer wise relevance et al. as future work. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
