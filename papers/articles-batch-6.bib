  abstract={A microservice architecture features hundreds or even thousands of small loosely coupled services with multiple instances. Because microservice performance depends on many factors including the workload, inter-service traffic management is complex in such dynamic environments. Service meshes aim to handle this complexity and to facilitate management, observability, and communication between microservices. Service meshes provide various traffic management policies such as circuit breaking and retry mechanisms, which are claimed to protect microservices against overload and increase the robustness of communication between microservices. However, there have been no systematic studies on the effects of these mechanisms on microservice performance and robustness. Furthermore, the exact impact of various tuning parameters for circuit breaking and retries are poorly understood. This work presents a large set of experiments conducted to investigate these issues using a representative microservice benchmark in a Kubernetes testbed with the widely used Istio service mesh. Our experiments reveal effective configurations of circuit breakers and retries. The findings presented will be useful to engineers seeking to configure service meshes more systematically and also open up new areas of research for academics in the area of service meshes for (autonomic) microservice resource management.},

  abstract={In the production environment, a large part of microservice failures are related to the complex and dynamic interactions and runtime environments, such as those related to multiple instances, environmental configurations, and asynchronous interactions of microservices. Due to the complexity and dynamism of these failures, it is often hard to reproduce and diagnose them in testing environments. It is desirable yet still challenging that these failures can be detected and the faults can be located at runtime of the production environment to allow developers to resolve them efficiently. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose MEPFL, an approach of latent error prediction and fault localization for microservice applications by learning from system trace logs. Based on a set of features defined on the system trace logs, MEPFL trains prediction models at both the trace level and the microservice level using the system trace logs collected from automatic executions of the target application and its faulty versions produced by fault injection. The prediction models thus can be used in the production environment to predict latent errors, faulty microservices, and fault types for trace instances captured at runtime. We implement MEPFL based on the infrastructure systems of container orchestrator and service mesh, and conduct a series of experimental studies with two opensource microservice applications (one of them being the largest open-source microservice application to our best knowledge). The results indicate that MEPFL can achieve high accuracy in intraapplication prediction of latent errors, faulty microservices, and fault types, and outperforms a state-of-the-art approach of failure diagnosis for distributed systems. The results also show that MEPFL can effectively predict latent errors caused by real-world fault cases.},

  abstract={Tracing has been applied to study and understand the behavior and performance of distributed systems. Despite the attention this topic has received, two important aspects are still challenges and especially harmful in the context of microservice-based applications: source code instrumentation and performance overhead. Existing attempts resort on working around overhead (e.g., sampling techniques) and do not address microservices architecture's high technological heterogeneity. Our main contribution is a novel approach for tracing microservices which joins proxies' usage (for handling tracing concerns) and operating system syscalls monitoring (for diagnosing causality between multiple requests). It makes advances on the field by completely separating instrumentation and application code while minimizing performance overhead. We carry out a performance evaluation to show the impact of our solution on the execution of microservice-based applications. Our proposal fosters developers' productivity by allowing them to focus on business logic instead of instrumentation and copes with the intrinsic heterogeneity of microservices by relying on deployment modifications and operating systems mechanisms solely.},

  abstract={Containers, renowned for their lightweight nature and flexibility, have seen growing adoption for deploying edge services such as web applications. However, existing cloud-oriented container deployment frameworks fail to address the unique challenges of edge environments, including geographical distribution, device heterogeneity, and resource constraints. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance for latency-sensitive edge services like HPC/AI-powered autonomous driving and edge gaming, which demand rapid startup and immediate responsiveness.Our investigation demonstrates that current on-demand image solutions require excessive client-registry communication, resulting in prolonged Round-Trip Time (RTT) - a particularly severe limitation in geographically distributed edge platforms. Furthermore, we observe that the user-space file system (e.g., FUSE), typically employed to handle device heterogeneity, introduces substantial overhead to the native I/O stack. More critically, our findings reveal that on-demand image solutions exacerbate storage pressure on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EDDE, an edge-optimized container deployment framework that redesigns the on-demand image pipeline. EDDE achieves up to 9.8 \texttimes{} higher deployment efficiency than standard Docker. When compared to state-of-the-art on-demand solutions, EDDE delivers containers 147\% faster on average, reduces native I/O latency by up to 28\%, and decreases storage usage by an average of 34\%.},

  abstract={Microservice applications are increasingly adopted in distributed data processing systems, such as in mobile edge computing and data mesh architectures. However, existing performance models of such systems fall short in providing comprehensive insights into the intricate interplay between data placement and data processing. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel class of performance models that enables joint analysis of data storage access workflows, caching, and queueing contention. Our proposed models introduce a notion of access path for data items to model hierarchical data locality constraints. We develop analytical solutions to efficiently approximate the performance metrics of these models under different data caching policies, finding in particular conditions under which the underlying Markov chain admits a product-form solution. Extensive trace-driven simulations based on real-world datasets indicate that service and data placement policies based on our proposed models can respectively improve by up to 35\% and 37\% the average response time in edge and data mesh case studies.},

  abstract={Serverless cloud functions transfer server management responsibilities to service providers, offering scalability and cost-efficiency. This convenience not only facilitates normal activities but also raises abuse concerns. So far, public understanding of real-world cloud functions remains limited. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth measurement study to uncover their practical usage and abuse. Through empirical analysis of nine leading providers (e.g., AWS, Tencent), we identified 531,089 function domains from a passive DNS dataset spanning April 2022 to March 2024. We first investigated the usage status of serverless cloud functions, showing the different practices between providers. Additionally, based on active requests to these functions, we pointed out privacy risks of unauthorized access and identified four abuse types, including covert C2 communication, hosting malicious websites, promoting illicit services, and abusing egress nodes as IP proxies. Alarmingly, 4.89\% of cloud functions are being abused, with over 614k invocations recorded. Only four abused functions were flagged by existing threat intelligence systems, indicating critical gaps in security monitoring for serverless environments. Our work offers insights into the serverless cloud ecosystem and provides recommendations for better management. With responsible disclosure, we hope to raise awareness and improve protective measures against abuses among cloud function providers.},

  abstract={Kubernetes is a popular open source software (OSS) tool to manage containers at scale. Despite being beneficial for rapid deployment, Kubernetes-based software deployments are susceptible to defects that can lead to serious consequences. A systematic analysis of development-related factors that cause defects can aid practitioners on how to mitigate these defects. We conduct an exploratory empirical study where we use causal analysis to quantify the impact of one development factor called minor contributors, which refers to practitioners who author &lt; 5\% of the total code. By analyzing 29,028 commits from 157 OSS repositories, we observe (i) 5.6\% of the 29,028 commits to be authored by minor contributors; and (ii) authorship of minor contributors to impact defects in configuration scripts. Based on our findings, we recommend researchers to (1) further investigate the characteristics of minor contributors; and (2) identify other development-related factors that may have a causal impact on defects in Kubernetes configuration scripts.},
