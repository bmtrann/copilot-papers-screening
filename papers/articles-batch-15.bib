  abstract={The Cloud computing paradigm has become the new industry standard way of designing large scale applications. Over the past years, we observe an increased adoption of this technology on numerous IoT- Edge applications. And while this technology comes with its promises and benefits, considering almost infinite scalability, it also comes along with its drawbacks and challenges. Detecting partial failures or bottlenecks are new obstacles that arose with the adoption of Cloud Applications. Distributed Tracing now allows developers to gain insight on the composition of services within a distributed Application. Today we observe an increased adoption of this technology on numerous cloud-native architectures. The project OpenTelemetry proposes a specification for traces that normalizes this new monitoring data format. In this publication we present an approach that leverages these traces to identify bottlenecks at the scale of a physically distributed application. We propose an extension of our model that builds a hierarchical property graph to exhibit bottlenecks in an application that follows the layered Cloud - IoT network model. Based on OpenTelemetry traces we can maintain a model at runtime of the whole application and compute bottlenecks. Their identification relies on the scores provided by centrality algorithms.},

  abstract={Given the importance of robustness and resilience in emerging cloud-native networks, effective monitoring for fault detection is paramount and In-band network telemetry (INT) is a key candidate that enables real-time and fine-grained network monitoring with a programmable data plane. However, INT increases bandwidth overhead because network information is inserted directly into the packet header. In this paper, we propose a quantized INT (QINT) to effectively reduce overhead by considering the distribution of raw data. In QINT, the programmable switch encodes a raw telemetry item into a quantized bit stream using the Huffman coding scheme. To do this, QINT monitors the distribution of network telemetry items and encodes high-frequency data that are generated most of the time in a few bits. We implemented QINT on a programmable switch and our experimental results demonstrate that QINT can reduce the relative bandwidth usage by up to 60.6% compared to traditional INT, respectively.},

  abstract={The service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer in a microservice architecture (MSA) to handle service-to-service communication through application programming interface (API) calls. The service mesh employs features for continuous monitoring and ensuring delivery of service requests among services securely and reliably. The service mesh should enable threat intelligence sharing among the services at runtime as a part of continuous monitoring so that services are aware of potential threats and adapt to mitigate the threats. Threat intelligence contains detailed descriptions of attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) that are analyzed for countermeasure deployment. In this paper, we introduce threat intelligence sharing (TIS) into the control plane of the service mesh to enable the sharing of threat intelligence among services in an automated manner. It requires a structured format to specify threat intelligence and a well-defined protocol for sharing intelligence. We adopt a structured threat information expression (STIX) schema to specify threat intelligence and use the trusted automated exchange of intelligence information (TAXII) as a defined protocol to share threat intelligence as STIX documents. The advantage of including a TIS component in the service mesh is that it can generate threat intelligence using available telemetry data and enable sharing among the services without forcing services to modify their functionalities to support the process. We experiment with the TIS component’s effectiveness using an open-source MSA application called Online Boutique, which uses the service mesh platform, Istio, and Kubernetes as the orchestration solution.},

  abstract={In traditional monitoring systems, the health status of services is typically assessed through metrics and logs. However, as the scope of monitoring expands from a monolithic architecture to a distributed system composed of multiple services or more granular microservices, traditional monitoring systems struggle to effectively pinpoint specific errors and their root causes. We propose an observability framework based on OpenTelemetry to generate trace data that captures contextual information and event correlations of requests thereby extending the existing monitoring system into an observability system. The study leverages a Hook to implement instrumentation in a PHP environment, ensuring minimal intrusiveness. Additionally, it traces intra-service function calls and inter-service requests to provide a thorough understanding of the execution path of requests.},

  abstract={Observability is fundamental for operating complex, dynamic, and distributed cloud-native systems at scale. With the rise of microservices and CloudOps, massive volumes of telemetry data overwhelm manual methods. Unlike prior surveys, this study introduces an Adaptive Observability–AIOps Integration Model (AOIM) that formalizes dynamic feedback between telemetry streams and AI-driven analytics. This framework is validated through two enterprise-scale case studies, providing statistically significant improvements in MTTD, MTTR, and false positive reduction. Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) leverages machine learning to automate the detection, analysis, and remediation in DevOps, enabling real-time actionable insights. This paper presents a comprehensive review of observability and AIOps for cloud-scale DevOps, detailing their principles, architectures, technical patterns, challenges, and practical implementations. We survey the latest research and industrial adoption, propose a reference architecture, analyze quantitative and qualitative case study findings, and outline critical future research opportunities.In two enterprise case studies, integration of AIOps with observability stacks resulted in dramatic operational improvements: mean time to detect (MTTD) dropped by over 80%, mean time to recovery (MTTR) fell by nearly 80%, alert volume decreased by 40%, and false-positive rates were cut in half. These outcomes demonstrate the tangible value of intelligent observability in accelerating DevOps workflows while enhancing resilience and efficiency.},

  abstract={The research community has been moving attention from Virtual Network Function (VNF) to Cloud-native Network Function (CNF) since cloudification has brought the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to an advanced level. It has already been demonstrated that cloud-native technology brings high flexibility and efficiency to large-scale network service deployment compared to the traditional VNF with Virtual Machines (VMs). However, more work is needed to provide a flexible and reliable Service Function Chaining (SFC) development solution in a cloud-native environment. This paper proposes a web-based orchestrator system to deploy an SFC use case consisting of multiple CNFs in a multi-node Kubernetes cluster using Network Service Mesh (NSM). We demonstrate a cloud-native SFC framework that allows users to dynamically create container-based SFC rather than the traditional VMs with NFV/SDN controller approach. Further, additional work is presented with the support of an open-source monitoring system, Prometheus, to validate the SFC path.},
