  abstract={Efficient resource orchestration within cloud-native and future 6G infrastructures is a major challenge and essential for maintaining seamless service delivery. We present a novel monitoring approach as part of the REASON 6G architecture that is designed to leverage microservices and cloud-native technologies, which extend beyond traditional technological or administrative domain boundaries, incorporating the edge domain within ubiquitous networks. The core of this approach is the development of Monitoring Applications (mApps) and the Matching Service. The former are microservices tracking/gathering data metrics from a data source such as the edge system, while the latter is a request-matching messaging system built on the WireMQ messaging library, with its appropriately designed well-defined Northbound (NB) and Southbound (SB) APIs facilitating secure, scalable data distribution across cloud-native environments. This microservice-based approach enhances flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in monitoring systems, making it particularly suitable for complex environments like 5G and future 6G networks. Moreover, it allows cross-domain extendability and interoperability through its hierarchical design. Our presented WireMQ-based prototype supports authentication and authorization, ensuring controlled and secure access to data. It also offers features like historical data storage, data watchers and triggers, and topic abstraction for data protection. In this work, we demonstrate its capabilities in a decentralised and distributed network.},

  abstract={Don’t fly blind. Observability gives you actionable insights into your cloud native systems—from pinpointing errors, to increasing developer productivity, to tracking compliance. Observability is the difference between an error message and an error explanation with a recipe how to resolve the error! You know exactly which service is affected, who’s responsible for its repair, and even how it can be optimized in the future. Cloud Observability in Action teaches you how to set up an observability system that learns from a cloud application’s signals, logging, and monitoring, all using free and open source tools. In Cloud Observability in Action you will learn how to:  Apply observability in cloud native systems Understand observability signals, including their costs and benefits Apply good practices around instrumentation and signal collection Deliver dashboarding, alerting, and SLOs/SLIs at scale Choose the correct signal types for given roles or tasks Pick the right observability tool for any given function Communicate the benefits of observability to management  A well-designed observability system provides insight into bugs and performance issues in cloud native applications. They help your development team understand the impact of code changes, measure optimizations, and track user experience. Best of all, observability can even automate your error handling so that machine users apply their own fixes—no more 3AM calls for emergency outages.},

  abstract={Microservices have emerged as a popular pattern for developing large-scale applications in cloud environments for their flexibility, scalability, and agility benefits. Furthermore, orchestration services like Kubernetes have simplified the deployment of cloud-native applications. However, monitoring and debugging these complex networked applications has become increasingly challenging, creating additional overheads. Traditionally, observability or monitoring requires developers to instrument their applications to expose metrics, logs, and traces using language-restricted libraries. This approach does not work well in a multi-tenant cloud environment as it cannot monitor processes or containers that are not instrumented or hidden. A critical challenge is managing complexity by consistently instrumenting multiple microservices across application platforms and programming languages. Hence, there is a need for a low-overhead cloud-native solution that provides complete observability for distributed and containerized environments. eBPF is a Linux VM technology that can instrument the host kernel directly and provides out-of-the-box cloud-native observability with negligible performance overheads. This paper proposes an eBPF-based solution that offers complete observability for cloudnative deployments. Further, we compare the performance and effectiveness of our solution with popular observability agents like Node Exporter and cAdvisor. We show that our proposed solution reduces CPU overheads by up to 210 times while requiring up to 159 % less memory than the alternatives. Lastly, we deploy and test our solution on a Chameleon cloud bare metal testbed.},

  abstract={Monitoring is a key feature to enhance systems with the capability to anticipate, detect, predict, and mitigate failures, while providing Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) guarantee. Monitoring frameworks can serve these purposes by deploying probes according to many possible patterns that have different features, for instance in terms of efficiency and privacy. So far, these probe deployment patterns have not been systematically defined, analyzed and assessed. Thus, engineers who design and configure their monitoring systems have to take decisions only based on partial knowledge and personal experience. This article addresses this knowledge gap, by presenting a systematic analysis of 11 probe deployment patterns, their known uses, and implementations. We assess these patterns qualitatively, and quantitatively using both VMs and containers. Results show the targets have negligible resource consumption (e.g., less than 1% CPU usage), while the probe holder consumption is mainly significant in relation to memory consumption, reaching up to 10 GiB in our experiments. Our findings suggest that reusing probes and holders among users can generally enhance efficiency and scalability when direct access to the monitored target is not an option. We generate a set of best practices that can assist engineers in configuring their monitoring systems. Finally, we showcase the application of certain patterns through three practical usage scenarios, which feature diverse technologies and requirements.},

  abstract={The last few years in the software engineering field have seen a paradigm shift from monolithic applications towards architectures in which the application is split in various smaller entities (i.e., microservices) fueled by the improved availability and ease of use of containers technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. Those microservices communicate with each other using networking technologies in place of function calls in traditional monolithic software. In order to be able to evaluate the potential, the modularity, and the scalability of this new approach, many tools, such as microservices benchmarking, have been developed with that objective in mind. Unfortunately, many of these tend to focus only on the application layer while not taking the underlying networking infrastructure into consideration, leading to difficulties in developing and testing telemetry tools. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate the performance of a new modular and scalable tool, MicroServices Topology Generator (MSTG), that allows one to simulate both the application and networking layers of a microservices architecture. Based on a topology described in Yaml format, Mstg generates the configuration file(s) for deploying the architecture on either Docker Compose or Kubernetes. Furthermore, Mstg encompasses telemetry tools, such as Application Performance Monitoring (APM) relying on OpenTelemetry and in-band telemetry (e.g., IOAM). This paper also discusses a use case in whic Mstg finds a suitable usage.},
