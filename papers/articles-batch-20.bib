  abstract={The Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) is a key component of the 5G Core Network (5GC), responsible for collecting, processing, and analyzing network data. This provides information and insights that improve network status understanding to enable decision making according to performance and adaptability policies. NWDAF is standardized by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). However, this interoperable 5G Network telemetry service should extend beyond this Core system, fueled by virtualization paradigms, at the edge, at the Radio Access Network (RAN) and even at the User Equipments (UEs) for private network setups. Thus, its practical implementation and extension remain open research challenges, especially to support new analytics functions of virtualized network resources. This paper presents an extended microservices-based NWDAF architecture that integrates both standardized NWDAF events and three additional analytics functions: Container Data Analytics Function (C-DAF), RAN Data Analytics Function (RAN-DAF), and UE Data Analytics Function (UE-DAF). These services enable full network observability of network segments by collecting real-time multi-layer metrics covering 5GC, RAN and UE domains, as well as cloud and edge infrastructures. The proposed framework remains fully compliant with 3GPP standards and design while improving monitoring of end-to-end 5G environments to support orchestration at different network segments.},

  abstract={The rise of open radio access networks (O-RANs) in 5G not only introduces unprecedented flexibility and interoperability but also expands the attack surface due to its cloud-native, multi-vendor architecture. To support the development of robust intrusion detection systems in this complex environment, we present NetsLab’s 5G O-RANs intrusion detection dataset (NetsLab-5GORAN-IDD), a comprehensive dataset collected from a live 5G O-RAN testbed at Network Softwarization and Security Labs (NetsLab), University College Dublin, Ireland. Unlike prior datasets that focus solely on higher layer traffic or simulated environments, 5G-ORAN-IDD integrates both network packet-level data and radio telemetry collected in parallel, capturing detailed insights from real-time device interactions. Packet-level data were gathered at the central unit (CU), while lower layer radio metrics were collected from distributed unit (DU) running on the RAN intelligent controller (RIC). The dataset includes benign and attack traffic targeting the O-Cloud Edge Server, encompassing various threat vectors such as synchronize (SYN), user datagram protocol (UDP), transmission control protocol (TCP), internet control message protocol (ICMP) floods, and port scans. This dataset addresses a critical gap in the field by offering a realistic, multi-layered resource for advancing 5G O-RAN security research for observing the radio-level behavior variations with the attack scenarios in comparison with the insights from the upper level network information.

  abstract={Microservices deployments in the real-world present significant challenges in detecting and localizing performance bottlenecks due to their scale, complexity, and dynamic interactions. This paper presents GUIDE, a GNN-based framework for unified incident detection and bottleneck localization, leveraging multisource telemetry and a customizable incident trigger warning mechanism. Specifically, GUIDE employs a novel integration of Graph Attention Networks, temporal embeddings, and an expert classifier to predict and localize bottlenecks efficiently in practice. Evaluation results on real-world traces collected from Observea live, cloud-native platform-show that GUIDE achieves an F1score of 87% for anomaly detection and 84% for bottleneck localization, outperforming existing baselines. Additionally, GUIDE’s incident trigger warning mechanism achieves an $\mathbf{F 1}$-score of $\mathbf{8 5} \boldsymbol{\%}$, ensuring early and accurate detection of system failures.},

  abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, the distributed cross-domain nature of microservices needs secure token service (STS), key management and encryption services for authentication and authorization, and secure communication protocols. Similarly, the nature of clustered containers (in which microservices are implemented) calls for secure service discovery. The availability requirement calls for: (a) resiliency techniques, such as load balancing, circuit breaking, and throttling, and (b) continuous monitoring (for the health of the service). The service mesh is the best-known approach that can facilitate the specification of these requirements at a level of abstraction such that it can be uniformly and consistently defined while also being effectively implemented without making changes to individual microservice code. The purpose of this work is to provide deployment guidance for a robust security infrastructure for supporting microservices-based applications.},

  abstract={This paper envisages an agent-based approach for creating resilient, self-managing microservice systems. The approach is based on a categorisation of the adaptation space for microservices across two dimensions – application/infrastructure and service-type/composition. The monitoring and adaptation actions in the quadrants defined by these dimensions are distinct, requiring controllers/agents with different management capabilities. Based on this division of responsibility, an agent-oriented architectural approach is proposed – the Agent Mesh. A service mesh provides the observability and control of a network overlay that connects agents and services, while agents with the different capabilities defined above close the control loops at the application and infrastructure levels. A core feature of the approach is that both domain (managed) services and managing agents are integrated as microservices within the same mesh, and communicate with each other via sidecar proxies, thereby allowing adaptation of both the domain services and self-adaptation of the agents.},

C-Shield aims to address the challenges of secure node registration, encrypted inter-node communication, runtime threat detection, and automated threat mitigation. The framework provides end-users with ready-to-use secure clusters, reducing the need for complex, manual deployment processes. It utilizes WireGuardbuilt overlay networks to establish strong encrypted communication among distributed Kubernetes nodes, while centralized monitoring collects network and system telemetry across multiple clusters. In order to improve threat detection and response, C Shield integrates Large Language Models for contextual security analysis, alert explanation, false positive reduction, and automated policy generation. We evaluated the effectiveness of C Shield subsystems through realistic experimental deployments and demonstrated their ability to provide end-to-end security for distributed Kubernetes infrastructures.},

  abstract={In contrast to the monolithic system, microservice architecture decouples the applications into independent service nodes. It enables rapid and reliable delivery among each other. However, transferring data among the service mesh is unavoidable. In this distributed architecture, user privacy data might flow through several service nodes to other ones without the user's awareness and acknowledgment. Hence, it is crucial to trace each service request and be aware of the extent to which personal data is exposed when services are exchanging messages. In this paper, we address the need for identifying any privacy-related concerns within the microservices architecture by building a Privacy and Security Risk Detection (PSRD) model that is based on distributed tracing. Further, we optimize the number of features to successfully classify the risk level of a particular request path correctly. We employ a fully connected neural network (FCNN) to classify the extent of the vulnerabilities that may occur within the path of a discovered service request. Through this model, it is then possible to detect any risks associated with personal data exposed to service providers or through a network of service nodes. Experimental and validation results from using the proposed approach demonstrate the usefulness of the PSRD model.},

  abstract={The service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer in a microservice architecture. It manages service-to-service communication within an application between decoupled or loosely coupled microservices (called services) without modifying their implementations. The service mesh includes APIs for security, traffic and policy management, and observability features. These features are enabled using a pre-defined configuration, which can be changed at runtime with human intervention. However, it has no autonomy to self-manage changes to the microservice application’s operational environment. A better configuration is one that can be customized according to environmental conditions during execution to protect the application from potential threats. This customization requires enabling self-protection mechanisms within the service mesh that evaluate the risk of environmental condition changes and enable appropriate configurations to defend the application from impending threats. In this paper, we design an assessment component into a service mesh that includes a security assurance case to define the threat model and dynamically assess the application given environment changes. We experiment with a demo application, Bookinfo, using an open-source service mesh platform, Istio, to enable self-protection. We consider certain parameters extracted from the service request as environmental conditions. We evaluate those parameters against the threat model and determine the risk of violating a security requirement for controlled and authorized information flow.},
