  abstract={Cloud-native systems enhance scalability and availability by leveraging containers. For better container management and scheduling, existing container management systems (e.g., Kubernetes) employ readiness and liveness probes to probe container status. However, failures in these probing systems can lead to traffic scheduling errors, application failures, or even cluster crashes, due to real-time probing issues or implementation bugs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a non-intrusive, real-time container status probing system based on eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), called eProbe. eProbe intercepts packets passing through containers to probe container status in real time within the operating system kernel, without additional instrumentation or modifications to existing container management systems. Our evaluations show that eProbe can accurately probe container status, whereas Kubernetes probes can only partially achieve this. Moreover, eProbe incurs a low overhead, consuming only 0.03\% to 0.26\% additional memory and 0.22\% to 0.33\% additional CPU, while introducing a 2.48\% increase in response time for cloud-native applications.},

  abstract={In an era where the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming integral to daily life, the demand for efficient computing solutions is rapidly increasing, and the orchestration of containers in fog computing environments has emerged as a critical area of research. Single-Board Computers (SBCs) are particularly well-suited to fog computing environments due to their low cost, energy efficiency, and local processing capabilities. However, the efficient orchestration of containerized applications on these resource-constrained machines at the cost of performance is still an open issue. This paper presents Chronos (Customizable Heuristic Resource Orchestrator for Node Optimization Scheduling), a customizable scheduling framework for Kubernetes designed to overcome existing architectural limitations. The framework features a programmable scheduling operator with advanced monitoring capabilities, enabling system administrators to adapt scheduling policies to application-specific needs. It operates by harnessing real-time telemetry and time-series performance data. Chronos was deployed on a realistic SBC testbed with representative services and synthetic workloads simulating user behavior. Experimental results show that Chronos improves performance and resource utilization over baseline scheduling algorithms. In particular, when compared to the default Kubernetes scheduler, Chronos customized scheduler was able to reduce network latency up to 23\% for network-intensive workloads, disk write operations up to 42 \% for disk-intensive workloads, and response time up to 20\% for CPU-intensive workloads, while maintaining low overhead.},

  abstract={Context The microservices architectural style is gaining momentum in the IT industry. This style does not guarantee that a target system can continuously meet acceptable performance levels. The ability to study the violations of performance requirements and eventually predict them would help practitioners to tune techniques like dynamic load balancing or horizontal scaling to achieve the resilience property. Objective The goal of this work is to study the violations of performance requirements of microservices through time series analysis and provide practical instruments that can detect resilient and non-resilient microservices and possibly predict their performance behavior. Method We introduce a new method based on growth theory to model the occurrences of violations of performance requirements as a stochastic process. We applied our method to an in-vitro e-commerce benchmark and an in-production real-world telecommunication system. We interpreted the resulting growth models to characterize the microservices in terms of their transient performance behavior. Results Our empirical evaluation shows that, in most of the cases, the non-linear S-shaped growth models capture the occurrences of performance violations of resilient microservices with high accuracy. The bounded nature associated with this models tell that the performance degradation is limited and thus the microservice is able to come back to an acceptable performance level even under changes in the nominal number of concurrent users. We also detect cases where linear models represent a better description. These microservices are not resilient and exhibit constant growth and unbounded performance violations over time. The application of our methodology to a real in-production system identified additional resilience profiles that were not observed in the in-vitro experiments. These profiles show the ability of services to react differently to the same solicitation. We found that when a service is resilient it can either decrease the rate of the violations occurrences in a continuous manner or with repeated attempts (periodical or not). Conclusions We showed that growth theory can be successfully applied to study the occurences of performance violations of in-vitro and in-production real-world systems. Furthermore, the cost of our model calibration heuristics, based on the mathematical expression of the selected non-linear growth models, is limited. We discussed how the resulting models can shed some light on the trend of performance violations and help engineers to spot problematic microservice operations that exhibit performance issues. Thus, meaningful insights from the application of growth theory have been derived to characterize the behavior of (non) resilient microservices operations.},

  abstract={The Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) on board Mars Express has been sampling the topside ionosphere of Mars since mid-2005. The analysis of the main reflection (nadir) of the ionosphere through the ionograms provided by the MARSIS instrument is typically performed manually due to the high noise level in the lower frequencies. This task, which involves pattern recognition, turns out to be unfeasible for the >2 million ionograms available at the European Planetary Science Archive. In the present contribution, we propose a modular architecture based on serverless computing (a paradigm that stands on the cloud) for optimal processing of these ionograms. In particular, we apply serverless computing to detect oblique echoes in the ionosphere, which are nonnadir reflections produced when MARSIS is sounding regions above or nearby crustal magnetic fields, where the ionosphere loses the spherical symmetry. Oblique echoes are typically observed at similar frequencies to the nadir reflections but at different times delays, sometimes even overlaying the nadir reflection. Oblique echoes are difficult to analyze with the standard technique due to their nonconstant and highly variable appearance, but they harbor essential information on the state of the ionosphere over magnetized regions. In this work we compare the proposed serverless architecture with two local alternatives while processing a representative data subset and finally provide a study by means of cost and performance.},

  abstract={The incorporation of smartphones and smart devices in daily business activities and processes is widespread in several industries. Due to its high use, it is required to monitor the device's health and uses patterns to achieve business continuity and conduct code compliance. The monitoring activity is currently implemented in the traditional IT paradigm, either on premises or in the cloud, deploying the solution in servers with fixed capacity and cost involved. This research proposes a novel approach to changing the paradigm by considering smart devices as one live entity with many health metrics ready to exploit their telemetry for monitoring IIoT concepts. The proposed approach introduces the serverless computing paradigm in the cloud to implement IIoT telemetry gather activity at lower costs with scalable capacity, and pro- poses the new architecture that can be implemented by different enterprises in any industry where smartphones and devices are part of daily business activities.},

  abstract={Fleet management is a series of processes that allows fleet owners to see and manage all information associated with their vehicles. Fleet management usually deals with a high volume of data being received and processed every second. This data can be the engine's fuel value, the current speed of the vehicle or the GPS location to name a few. Collectively, this type of data is called telemetry data. From this telemetry data, the fleet owners can derive timely and meaningful insights such as monitoring vehicle health, location and behaviour of anomalous drivers. These insights are essential for optimal and reliable business decision-making. The fleet management problem has been well-researched over the past decade, and most of the solutions proposed involve one or more types of ELT or ETL pipelines. They are usually purely server-based solutions. The main drawback of most of the solutions is that they increase the investment costs significantly. Therefore, this research aims to propose and build a Telepulse Framework which is cost-efficient, serverless solution for the fleet management problem with high development speed.},
