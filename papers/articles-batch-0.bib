  abstract={The rise of cloud computing has transformed application development and deployment, with Kubernetes emerging as a key platform for managing containerized applications. This paper explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to detect anomalies in Kubernetes clusters and proposes GNN-based Anomaly Detection in Kubernetes (GATAKU), which is instrumental in maintaining security and performance. Our work involves integrating Cilium for detailed network monitoring and data collection, setting up a Kubernetes cluster with k3s and Traefik, and simulating attack scenarios to generate realistic data. Data preprocessing and feature engineering prepare this data for the GNN training. We present the GATAKU model’s performance, highlighting metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 -score and compare it to baseline ML models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). Moreover, we discuss these findings and emerging challenges, including handling high-dimensional data, and explore practical implications for cybersecurity.},

  abstract={Kubernetes (K8s) has become the cornerstone solution for orchestrating containerized applications across cloud-edge computing environments. Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins are crucial in this ecosystem, enabling network connectivity among K8s components, supporting advanced features and facilitating robust network management across diverse environments, such as centralized cloud or decentralized edge locations. In this paper, we extend our previous work, focusing on the various features, either built-in or non-native, provided within each networking solution and across diverse resource-intense and lightweight K8s distributions. Along these lines, tunneling options, security and encryption mechanisms, as well as common service mesh and observability tools have been evaluated with regards to their performance and resource utilization.},

  abstract={Modern services consist of interconnected components, e.g., microservices in a service mesh or machine learning functions in a pipeline. These services can scale and run across multiple network nodes on demand. To process incoming traffic, service components have to be instantiated and traffic assigned to these instances, taking capacities, changing demands, and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements into account. This challenge is usually solved with custom approaches designed by experts. While this typically works well for the considered scenario, the models often rely on unrealistic assumptions or on knowledge that is not available in practice (e.g., a priori knowledge). We propose DeepCoord, a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that learns how to best coordinate services and is geared towards realistic assumptions. It interacts with the network and relies on available, possibly delayed monitoring information. Rather than defining a complex model or an algorithm on how to achieve an objective, our model-free approach adapts to various objectives and traffic patterns. An agent is trained offline without expert knowledge and then applied online with minimal overhead. Compared to a state-of-the-art heuristic, DeepCoord significantly improves flow throughput (up to 76%) and overall network utility (more than 2x) on real-world network topologies and traffic traces. It also supports optimizing multiple, possibly competing objectives, learns to respect QoS requirements, generalizes to scenarios with unseen, stochastic traffic, and scales to large real-world networks. For reproducibility and reuse, our code is publicly available.},

  abstract={When faults occur in microservice applications - as they inevitably do - developers depend on observability data to quickly identify and diagnose the issue. To collect such data, microservices need to be instrumented and the respective infrastructure configured. This task is often underestimated and error-prone, typically relying on many ad-hoc decisions. However, some of these decisions can significantly affect how quickly faults are detected and also impact the cost and performance of the application. Given its importance, we emphasize the need for a method to guide the observability design process. In this paper, we build on previous work and integrate our observability experiment tool OXN into a novel method for continuous observability assurance. We demonstrate its use and discuss future directions.},

  abstract={Data products are emerging as architectural elements of data mesh with the aim of improving data management within organizations. Among the main aspects in the design of a data product is the need to define the policies that regulate its access. These policies concern not only security aspects but, more generally, compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) or organizational regulations. Taking advantage of similarities with microservice-based solutions, policy-as-code is also used in the data mesh to regulate access to data products. Following the proposed models for the service mesh which regulates a microservice-based environment, the performance of the Policy Decision Point (PDP) becomes crucial to ensure efficient access to data managed by data products. Since this may require a replication of PDPs, in order to achieve true scalability, each of them will have to take into account only the policies associated with the data products under their responsibilities. This work provides a solution to automate the replication of PDPs and the distribution of policies to be controlled according to an approach that balances policy consistency and system scalability. The work has been validated through an extension of the Kubernetes orchestrator that, based on the information collected from the monitoring system, it is able to define which is the right number of PDPs and which data product, and related policies, should be assigned to each of them. Notably, the policy management is based on a Open Policy Agent (OPA) implementation.},

  abstract={When organizations start implementing microservices and the concept of continuous delivery pipeline, especially while using DevOps, deploying becomes a crucial task in which safety is a significant concern. Canary releases have become a profound practice for rolling out new application updates to a limited number of users in an organization to avoid introducing new bugs in the critical production environment. Nonetheless, catching and validating issues during canary rollouts is often an irreversible process prone to mistakes. This technical paper focuses on the concept of Automated Canary Analysis for the implementation of Kubernetes and the role performed by the ACA over Service Mesh, Observability, and Metrics for making efficient deployment decisions. ACA derives performance differences as well as user experience effects between canary and baseline versions through statistical and machine learning algorithms. The study also considers existing open-source tools, namely Kayenta and Flagger, and establishes their capacity to perform automation of progressive delivery. Our results show a reduction in the use of the deployment risk factor while also improving the efficiency of the developers and the overall functionality of the system; therefore, ACA should be considered an important element of modern DevOps.},

  abstract={Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are now integrated in automated systems that enhance code stability, and accelerate the deployment process as well as improving monitoring of the whole system in the software development field. This document deals with setting up of a strong CI/CD process involving AWS cloud services and DevOps. The infrastructure is built with the help of Terraform which ensures the scalability and repeatability applying the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach. A safe Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is designed consisting of public and private subnets, load balancing for traffic distribution, and CloudFront CDN to improve geographical distribution. Jenkins is used in CI process to perform disk analysis, OWASP and Trivy vulnerability scanning, and making Docker images. The CD phase use ArgoCD for updates on Kubernetes and integrates Monitoring and observability using Prometheus and Grafana. Notifications are produced to JIRA and email communication for improvement. With the help of the offered cloud services and DevOps tool it is possible to consolidate the SDLC and bring effects in code safety, testing and utilization. This document also provides an overview of methods, instruments, and outcomes, demonstrating how the CI/CD automation influences the development and operation positively.},
