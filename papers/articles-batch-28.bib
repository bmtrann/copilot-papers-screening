  abstract={Learn the value that OpenTelemetry can bring to organizations that aim to implement observability best practices, and gain a deeper understanding of how different building blocks interact with each other to bring out-of-the-box, vendor-neutral instrumentation to your stack. With examples in Java, this book shows how to use OpenTelemetry APIs and configure plugins and SDKs to instrument services and produce valuable telemetry data. You'll learn how to maximize adoption of OpenTelemetry and encourage the change needed in debugging workflows to reduce cognitive load for engineers troubleshooting production workloads. Adopting observability best practices across an organization is challenging. This book begins with a discussion of how operational monitoring processes widely followed for decades fall short at providing the insights needed for debugging cloud-native, distributed systems in production. The book goes on to show how the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's OpenTelemetry project helps you standardize instrumentation and transport of telemetry signals, providing a common language for all observability tooling. You Will Learn Why observability is a necessity in modern distributed systems The value of OpenTelemetry for engineers and organizations OpenTelemetry component specification and general design Tracing, metrics, and logs APIs and SDKs, with examples in Java OpenTelemetry Collectors and recommended transport and processing pipelines How to adopt observability standards across an organization Who This Book Is For Software engineers familiar with cloud-native technologies and operational monitoring who want to instrument and export telemetry data from their services; observability leads who want to roll out OpenTelemetry standards and bestpractices across their organizations; and Java developers who want a book with OpenTelemetry examples in that language. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Observations of the Earth from remote sensing satellites are downloaded to various data systems on the Earth for processing, storage, and analysis. But with increasing complexity of the instruments, computer systems, science requirements, and algorithms, the amount of data to process has become so large that traditional science data systems and how data are handled can no longer be used. These forcing functions now require novel ways to handle the increased data such as moving all end-to-end data systems to be collocated in common cloud computing regions. The science data systems must also be rearchitected to be cloud enabled to be able to support petabyte-scale data processing and elastic processing demands and to utilize cloud-native services to be able to scale up efficiently to support the new data processing requirements. Science Data Systems (SDSes) provide the capability to develop, test, process, and analyze instrument observational data efficiently, systematically, and at large scales. SDSes ingest the raw satellite instrument observations and process them from low-level instrument values into higher level observational measurement values that compose the science data products. Before the advent of the cloud paradigm, the machinery for the SDS had mostly been hosted and operated on-premise at data centers owned and operated by the respective stakeholders. However, technological advancements in the satellite platform, resource availability, instrument sensitivities, communications downlink bandwidth, and improved science processing algorithms have resulted in increasingly larger mission science data volumes and data rates. These larger requirements and cost constraints are forcing functions for moving science data systems as well as other associated data systems in the enterprise onto the cloud. However, at big data scales, anomalous system behaviors such as resiliency and stability of the data system must also be addressed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In recent years, the diversification, complexity, immediacy, and scale of delivery and operational requirements have increased exponentially. For example, delivering and managing complex service mesh and various cloud-native technologies, supporting a variety of operations on infrastructures, such as database, load balancer, dynamic configuration, etc, configuring monitoring for all types of applications, and arranging a range of variety of services and applications to regions across data centers or public clouds. These are just a glimpse of the leopard, and it is actually difficult to list them all. By summarizing and abstracting, we propose the KCL declarative language, development mechanism, and consistent workflow. Through the language model and constraint capabilities, we can improve the large-scale efficiency and liberate multi-team collaborative productivity of operational development and operation systematically while ensuring stability for large-scale configuration and policy management. KCL helps users of various roles to complete operational development and operation tasks in a simple, scalable, stable, efficient, divided-and-conquered manner. To date, the KCL has been used in more than 800 projects, and the average configuration writing and distributing time is shortened from more than 25 days to 2 days. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={MICADO, the near-infrared Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations and designated ELT first-light instrument, will require dedicated software tools for observation preparation. In this context, the European Southern Observatory is currently employing a uniform and distributed architecture, which expects business logic to be provided as microservices on an ESO host. This particularly applies to the MICADO-specific features, too: Automatic guide star selection, AO performance calculation, and telescope offset permissibility checks are first candidates for a microservice implementation here. We present our approach of adapting MICADO tasks to ESO's distributed architecture and share our view on the new paradigm in general. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Determining the root cause of performance regression for microservices is challenging. The topological cascading performance implications among microservices hide the source of the problem. Additionally, the lack of knowledge about application phases can potentially lead to false-positive critical service detection. Service resource utilization is an imperfect proxy for application performance, potentially leading to false positives. Therefore, in this work, we propose a new performance testing framework that leverages hidden Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) kernel metrics to locate root causes of performance regression. The framework applies a systematic multi-level approach to analyze microservice performance without intrusive code instrumentation. First, the framework constructs an attributed graph with microservice requests, scores the services to identify the critical paths, and ranks the low-level metrics to highlight the root cause of performance regression. Through judiciously designed experiments, we evaluated the metric collection overhead, showing less than 18\% more latency when the application is running across hosts and 9\% within the same host. In addition, depending on the application, no overhead is experienced, while the state-of-the-art approach presented up to 1060\% more latency. The microservice benchmark evaluation shows that MicroLens can successfully identify the set of root causes and that the causes vary when the application is running in different infrastructures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Reference architectures are becoming increasingly popular for industry and researchers as benchmark solutions to test their novel concepts and tools. While many reference architectures exist in the microservice domain, they are often not built on state-of-the-art technologies. Furthermore, many existing reference architectures do not use lightweight and asynchronous communications, such as messaging, do not have out-of-the-box self-adaptation and do not consider state-of-the-art microservice patterns. Therefore, this paper proposes a self-adaptive microservice reference architecture that implements the microservice saga pattern. The architecture is implemented in Java Spring Boot and uses the Eventuate Tram framework for the saga orchestration. Moreover, the architecture is instrumented to export performance metrics for monitoring and data for system-wide tracing to check for correct execution of the system and its adaptations. The objective of this reference architecture is to provide a benchmark for explaining self-adaptation and propagation of service-level objective (SLOs) violations across an architecture with complex patterns. In addition to the architecture, we provide defined SLOs and load profiles to stress the architecture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, the distributed cross-domain nature of microservices needs secure token service (STS), key management and encryption services for authentication and authorization, and secure communication protocols. Similarly, the nature of clustered containers (in which microservices are implemented) calls for secure service discovery. The availability requirement calls for: (a) resiliency techniques, such as load balancing, circuit breaking, and throttling, and (b) continuous monitoring (for the health of the service). The service mesh is the best-known approach that can facilitate the specification of these requirements at a level of abstraction such that it can be uniformly and consistently defined while also being effectively implemented without making changes to individual microservice code. The purpose of this work is to provide deployment guidance for a robust security infrastructure for supporting microservices-based applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
