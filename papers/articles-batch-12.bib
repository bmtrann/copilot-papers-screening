  abstract={ContextIdentifying the possible root causes of observed failures is crucial in microservice applications, as much as explaining how such possible root failures propagated across the microservices forming an application. This can indeed help pick countermeasures avoiding observed failures to happen again, e.g., by introducing circuit breakers or bulkheads avoiding the root failures to propagate and cause those observed.ObjectiveThis paper aims at enabling to explain observed failures in microservice applications, either searching for all possible cascading failures or focusing only on those starting in a known root cause.MethodWe propose a log-based root cause analysis technique, which declaratively determines the cascading failures that possibly caused an observed failure. We also enable exploiting our proposed technique in practice, by introducing a logging methodology to instrument applications to log their failures and service interactions, and by enabling to analyse such logs through yRCA, a prototype implementation of our proposed root cause analysis technique.ResultsThe practical usability of our proposed technique is assessed by means of a case study and controlled experiments. The case study shows the low effort for instrumenting a third-party application to produce the logs needed by our technique and its effectiveness in explaining injected failures. The controlled experiments further assess our technique's effectiveness and performances in explaining failures obtained with an existing chaos testbed.ConclusionOur proposed technique can help to identify the cascading failures that possibly caused an observed failure in a microservice application. It can be used to determine all possible cascading failures, or to explain how cascading failures propagated from a known root cause (e.g., identified with some other existing root cause analyser).},

  abstract={The microservice system architecture (MSA) outperforms the monolithic system architecture in terms of maintainability, extensibility, scalability, and fault tolerance. This is prompting a widescale migration of software systems from existing monolith systems to MSA. Most microservice systems utilize container technology for deployment. The fact that Kubernetes (K8s) provides a fully-fledged toolchain for managing container-based applications is prompting many organizations to adopt the K8s protocol for microservice system deployment and operations. Microservice monitoring is essential to the success of any service operation. The collection of logs and aggregation of metrics by most existing microservice monitoring systems is somewhat intrusive. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of Kubernetes technology means that most monitoring methods are inapplicable in situations where microservices are developed for a system using a variety of underlying languages and platforms. In the current study, we developed a monitoring mechanism that provides various metrics specific to microservice systems in a nonintrusive way. The proposed K8s-based microservice monitoring system, referred to as KMamiz (Kubernetes-based Microservice Analysis and Monitoring using Istio and Zipkin), enables the construction and visualization for service-level/endpoint-level dependency graphs and endpoint request chains, and the service cohesion/coupling analysis to enhance system quality for the development team.},

  abstract={In today's fast-paced software development landscape, the importance of robust monitoring solutions cannot be overstated. To achieve comprehensive observability in complex, distributed systems, it is essential to know how to connect Kafka for data streaming, OpenTelemetry for instrumentation, Prometheus for metrics gathering, and Grafana for visualization. With Kafka, data can be transmitted between dispersed systems with ease and real-time insights into the behavior of applications are obtained. OpenTelemetry gathers telemetry information from multiple sources, providing thorough insight into performance indicators and facilitating the tracking of requests throughout microservices. As a central point for metrics collecting, Prometheus collects information on the health of the system and the performance of applications. Real-time issue detection and decision-making are facilitated by Grafana's visualization capabilities, which transform this data into actionable insights. In today's cutthroat market, this alignment is essential to meeting service level agreements (SLAs), accomplishing company objectives, and providing great user experiences. By adopting a holistic approach to monitoring and leveraging real-time insights, organizations can enhance system reliability, agility, and performance, ultimately driving business success in the digital era.},

  abstract={With the development of the latest technology, a flexible and efficient container-based cloud-native infrastructure that breaks away from the existing monolithic architecture is in the spotlight. As a result, the role of observability for visualization and fault detection of infrastructure has increased for the reliability of cloud-native infrastructures. Distributed tracing, one of observability, is used as data useful for pinpointing request bottlenecks between services in a micro-service infrastructure. However, in order to import distributed trace data from existing microservice environments, adding instrumentation libraries to service applications must be preceded. Adding additional library makes difficult to expand or manage the service applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed tracing system that can be easily managed from the perspective of managers and developers by providing traces of services regardless of the structure or network interface of the service or infrastructure.},

  abstract={The increasing adoption of AI-driven microservices in large-scale distributed systems has amplified the complexity of system monitoring, performance tuning, and failure resolution. This paper presents a scalable observability architecture tailored specifically for AI-driven microservices, addressing the inherent opacity and dynamism of AI workloads. By integrating fine-grained telemetry, trace correlation, anomaly detection, and model-centric metrics, the proposed framework enables enhanced visibility across the entire AI pipeline—from data ingestion to model inference. Our approach demonstrates improved root cause analysis, reduced system downtime, and increased transparency in model performance behavior. The architecture is validated through a real-world deployment on a Kubernetes-based AI platform, showing minimal performance overhead while maintaining high fidelity in observability signals. This work contributes a blueprint for building resilient, transparent, and scalable AI-driven systems, critical for operations in production environments.},

  abstract={The rise of cloud-based microservices means that how we design and deploy large-scale distributed applications is fundamentally changing. The benefits of microservices include scalability, more flexible and faster development. However, the highly flexible and interconnected nature of microservices presents many challenges to maintaining system reliability. An example of such a roadblock is predicting and preventing errors before they can manifest into service degradations or outages. Traditional rule-based monitoring systems can only detect faults after performance has already degraded, reducing the capacity to actively prevent slowdowns. This research output enables real-time observability data and provides a machine learningbased approach to fault prediction for cloud-based microservices. The framework utilizes the Google 2019 Cluster Trace dataset - one of the largest operational trace datasets - containing pervasive application and system-level metrics such as CPU utilization, page cache memory, cycles per instruction (CPI), memory accesses per instruction (MAI), and scheduling class. These are combined with feature engineering, solid preprocessing steps, and multiple classification algorithms. The ability of six machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Histogram Gradient Boosting, Linear Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost) to classify cases into normal or fault-prone was assessed. Ensemble techniques were also applied, and for this task, both interpretable and complex models provided high-performance solutions. The system architecture is designed to be flexible, scalable, and capable of providing insights into faults to prevent them from occurring in real time. From the results, it is evident that real-time failure prediction solutions require good telemetry, robust preprocessing, and suitable algorithms. The proposed approach challenges the Interpretability vs Accuracy trade-off, which must coexist with operational feasibility, reflecting the ongoing evolution of predictive reliability engineering within microservices.},
