  abstract={Fifth-generation ($\mathbf{5 G}$) mobile networks increasingly rely on containerized microservices and multi-interface configurations to meet the stringent performance, scalability, and flexibility demands of modern digital infrastructures. While these architectures support modular, high-performance deployments, they pose significant challenges for end-to-end observability, particularly in capturing control- and user-plane protocols such as NGAP, PFCP, and GTP-U. Existing monitoring solutions, predominantly optimized for HTTP traffic and dependent on sidecar-based service meshes, are ill-equipped for multi-cluster environments where traffic traverses secondary virtual interfaces provisioned by Multus CNI. We introduce Reotina, an eBPFbased observability framework that enables protocol-aware visibility in cloud-native 5 G environments. Reotina performs inkernel, interface-level traffic introspection and enriches packet data with Kubernetes context, operating transparently across multiple interfaces and clusters. By correlating protocol events with workload identity, it supports structured telemetry for performance analysis and operational insight. We evaluate Reotina in a Kubernetes-based, multi-cluster free5GC testbed, where it achieves full coverage of NGAP, PFCP, and GTP-U transactions with under 2% CPU overhead and sub-millisecond latency in cross-cluster session reconstruction. These results demonstrate that Reotina enables scalable, low-overhead observability for production-grade 5 G systems, effectively addressing key limitations of existing monitoring solutions.},

  abstract={There is an exponential growth in observability data—including metrics, logs, traces, and events in modern cloud-native systems. Among these, events represent a specific type of telemetry data that often requires immediate attention, as they signal discrete occurrences such as anomalies, threshold breaches, or critical system changes. While comprehensive observability is essential for effective monitoring and troubleshooting, the sheer volume of event traffic can overwhelm operators, drain resources, and drive up operational costs. This paper introduces a dynamic rate-limiting algorithm tailored to suppress duplicate events, addressing the dual challenge of maintaining comprehensive observability while reducing noise. By dynamically adjusting event forwarding rates based on frequency patterns, the algorithm ensures critical anomalies are represented while suppressing redundant event traffic. Leveraging statistical measures and adaptive reset mechanisms, this approach optimizes event pipelines for efficiency without compromising diagnostic utility. We also demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness, achieving an 8.6x reduction in forwarded events while retaining actionable insights, paving the way for scalable and cost-effective event management in cloud-native environments.},

Meeting these demands requires implementing intelligent and autonomous networks. Observability plays a crucial role in enabling data-driven Orchestration within this context. This paper presents Telco-Observer, an innovative solution tightly integrated with Management & Orchestration systems, designed to collect and provide efficient access to telemetry data across distributed cloud native edge environments. To the best of our knowledge, no existing solutions fully incorporate Observability at the Telco edge while supporting efficient Orchestration. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that Telco-Observer incurs minimal overhead while collecting a broad spectrum of telemetry signals and providing fast data access.},

  abstract={Modern heterogeneous networks and distributed applications deployed across the computing continuum pose significant monitoring and management challenges due to their complexity and dynamic nature. Cloud-native observability has emerged as a powerful paradigm to overcome these challenges, enabling the extraction of knowledge and operational insights by combining information from metrics, logs, and traces. At the same time, advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques drive network automation toward Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM). In this work, we present FUSION, an integrated observability and analytics framework that unifies heterogeneous telemetry data and leverages AI-powered intelligence to extract knowledge, identify behavioral patterns, and increase automation. A conceptual architecture is detailed, standardizing heterogeneous data collection and fusion in a unified observability layer, while supporting the integration of advanced AI-based analytics pipelines. A prototype implementation demonstrates the use of representative AI-based methods for anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and intelligent orchestration.},

  abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Operational Technology (OT) are becoming more and more connected. To keep up, we need strong, expandable networks that can identify problems right away and make predictions. Together, edge-to-cloud telemetry, human-in-the-loop AI, and continuous ML lifecycle management are used in this study to show a cloud-native design that can protect Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Azure Event Hubs are used to feed data with low latency, MLflow is used to track and retrain models, and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) input is used for adaptive anomaly detection. The suggested method works as shown by a real-life case study in a petroleum pipeline monitoring system. The system was able to identify anomalies 94.7% of the time, had 38.5% less detection delay than most edge-only models, and was up 22% more of the time. Using streaming feedback loops cut the time it took to reset the model to less than 30 minutes, which made it more adaptable in real time. These results indicate that cloud-native predictive models could be used in mission-critical OT systems. This would make them safe, scalable, and smart for use in Industry 4.0.},

  abstract={Cyber security operations centres (CSOC) are an essential business differentiator for digital services. They perform the challenging tasks of monitoring digital services such that when an attack is detected against the monitored digital services, they can respond swiftly ensuring cyber incidents are appropriately managed through to recovery. To monitor business services, the CSOC must first on-board those business services onto their security monitoring and incident management platforms. This process of onboarding business services to CSOC's security monitoring and incident management platform is described as Cybersecurity Onboarding. Cybersecurity Onboarding is a specialist technical process of setting up and configuring digital business services to generate appropriate interaction telemetry, such as events, logs, messages, metrics, and observables. These telemetric indicators when correlated and analysed reveal whether the business service may have been compromised or not. In this paper we rethink the approach to onboarding services to CSOC. A new approach of cybersecurity onboarding that is cyclic, simpler, quicker, efficient, and cost optimised by leveraging cloud-native and cloud-enabled technologies is discussed.},
