  abstract={So far, the In-Band Network Telemetry (INT) standard has been implemented mainly on P4 programmable switches. Observing packets as they travel through switches is knowing only half of the story. In this poster, we present the work in progress on Host-INT, an open-source solution based on eBPF and integrated with Kubernetes that extends INT support to the Linux network stack. When coupled with a P4-based Switch-INT implementation, Host-INT enables end-to-end network visibility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Event Sourcing (ES) systems use an event log with the double purpose of keeping application state and providing decoupled communication. While ES systems keep track of all business events, other untracked events, either from internal components or from external systems may still cause failures. Determining the root cause of such failures usually involves complex procedures based on replaying the event log. Unlike this, in distributed systems, developers often instrument the source code, for the sake of improving observability and perform tracing on workflows and data. Adding tracing to ES thus seems like an unexplored and powerful approach to improve the observability of the system. In this paper, we suggest possible implementations of the idea and discuss their merits. These include the adoption of well-known tracing-related tools and standards in ES systems, with the respective advantages for root-cause analysis, anomaly detection, profiling and others. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={The benefits provided by microservices architecture in some application scenarios are a motivating factor for organizations to migrate their monoliths to this architecture. Extracting microservices from existing monolithic code bases presents a key challenge in this context, and there is a lack of tools that automate not only the decomposition processes but also the evaluation of the resulting architecture. This work presents a new approach for microservice decomposition that analyzes source code of a monolithic application and, with the combined use of approaches in the literature, suggests parts to be extracted in microservices considering the artifacts: classes, methods and/or history of modifications. The quality of the microservices' suggestions are assessed, quantitatively, through the silhouette coefficient, a quality metric used in clustering analysis, and the microservice granularity. A tool was developed to automate the process of microservice decomposition for Java repositories. As a result, it was observed that the tool generated clusters with satisfactory results and can be used as an auxiliary instrument by experts during the migration process from monolithic architecture to microservices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Third-party security analytics allow companies to outsource threat monitoring tasks to teams of experts and avoid the costs of in-house security operations centers. By analyzing telemetry data from many clients these services are able to offer enhanced insights, identifying global trends and spotting threats before they reach most customers. Unfortunately, the aggregation that drives these insights simultaneously risks exposing sensitive client data if it is not properly sanitized and tracked. In this work, we present SCIFFS, an automated information flow monitoring framework for preventing sensitive data exposure in third-party security analytics platforms. SCIFFS performs decentralized information flow control over customer data it in a serverless setting, leveraging the innate polyinstantiated nature of serverless functions to assure precise and lightweight tracking of data flows. Evaluating SCIFFS against a proof-of-concept security analytics framework on the widely-used OpenFaaS platform, we demonstrate that our solution supports common analyst workflows data ingestion, custom dashboards, threat hunting) while imposing just 3.87\% runtime overhead on event ingestion and the overhead on aggregation queries grows linearly with the number of records in the database (e.g., 18.75\% for 50,000 records and 104.27\% for 500,000 records) as compared to an insecure baseline. Thus, SCIFFS not only establishes a privacy-respecting model for third-party security analytics, but also highlights the opportunities for security-sensitive applications in the serverless computing model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Site Reliability Engineers are at the center of two tensions: On one hand, they need to respond to alerts within a short time, to restore a non-functional system. On the other hand, short response times is disruptive to everyday life and lead to alert fatigue. To alleviate this tension, many resource management mechanisms are proposed handle overload and mitigate the faults. One recent such mechanism is circuit breaking in service meshes. Circuit breaking rejects incoming requests to protect latency at the expense of availability (successfully answered requests), but in many scenarios achieve neither due to the difficulty of knowing when to trigger circuit breaking in highly dynamic microservice environments. We propose an adaptive circuit breaking mechanism, implemented through an adaptive controller, that not only avoids overload and mitigate failure, but keeps the tail response time below a given threshold while maximizing service throughput. Our proposed controller is experimentally compared with a static circuit breaker across a wide set of overload scenarios in a testbed based on Istio and Kubernetes. The results show that our controller maintains tail response time below the given threshold 98\% of the time (including cold starts) on average with an availability of 70\% with 29\% of requests circuit broken. This compares favorably to a static circuit breaker configuration, which features a 63\% availability, 30\% circuit broken requests, and more than 5\% of requests timing out. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={The detection and identification of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks remains a challenge in cloud/edge/fog computing environments. It usually requires network middleboxes, such as deep packet inspectors (DPI), for detection task mostly. But clouds and fogs have native powerful telemetry systems that are not yet fully exploited for DDoS detection; and provide so much information that could aid attack identification tasks as well. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can help one diving into the richness of cloud’s native data collection services, which have a multitude of metrics from both physical and virtual hosts. This paper evaluates the use of ML algorithms over datasets collected from a experimental testbed based on OpenStack. Controlled attack scenarios were used to investigate the ability of ML for tasks such as detecting and identifying SYN\_Flood and GET\_Flood DDoS attacks mixed, in different proportions, with legitimate clients. kNN and Random Forest ML algorithms were trained and tested, and for evaluation the metrics accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score were used. Our experiments presented about 87\% of accuracy in the detection of SYN\_Flood and GET\_Flood DDoS attacks, whereas Snort IDS mostly fails to detect the latter attack by processing the corresponding packet traces. Also, the detection of PING\_Flood DDoS attack was tested without training as an initial evaluation towards the generalization of the proposal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={The current agricultural systems generally uses chemical fertilizers as a growth booster in order to meet the global food needs of 7 billion people and all of their livestock. But unfortunately not all are aware of the great danger behind such an overuse, unmetered application of chemical fertilizers, freely in an open field for the survival of the planet and its population. Thanks to technological advances, especially in the field of instrumentation and communication technology, the problem of increasing efficiency and avoiding such overuse should be minimized properly. In this study, the researchers tried to apply capacitive moisture sensor technology and serverless Internet of Things to the moisture meter instrument in the hydroponic drip fertigation system with roasted husk planting media. Capactive sensor technology has the advantage of corrosion resistance when applied to planting media containing high humidity and low alkalinity. By using a serverless IoT architecture, it is possible to monitor from anywhere via the internet, without involving complicated and expensive infrastructure. Based on the results of the prototype testing, it is known that the instruments built can work properly. The results of monitoring system conditions such as temperature and free heap appear stable. The reading results of the two sensors also run steadily, without fluctuations and variations in the reading that exceed 5\%. The process of remote monitoring and data logging to serverless IoT is monitored to be stable with a data recording success rate of 99.8\%. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={An enterprise architecture is an instrument that focuses on coherence between business processes, information distribution, and technology infrastructure of an organization. In this compilation, the authors begin by creating and subsequently discussing an artifact that provides architects with the capability of monitoring validity within ArchiMate enterprise architecture models. Next, it is suggested that business specialists and enterprise architects can benefit from collocated training, and that training activities in enterprise architecture are both one-off training and recurring training, where the latter is providing a community of practice. The authors consider ideas that may make it easier for organizations to realize the potential benefits of service-oriented architectures and cloud computing, as one of the challenges for software engineers today is keeping up with the rapid changes in technology. The major features underlying microservice architecture are examined, particularly the advantages and the disadvantages of their technologies and implementation. This analysis also highlights the major capabilities of microservices in driving future advances in the software and hardware industries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
