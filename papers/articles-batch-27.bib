  abstract={Context: The emerging service mesh architecture tries to simplify microservices by delegating crucial tasks to dedicated infrastructure. However, service mesh introduces new notions and enables complex capabilities such as sidecar proxies that inevitably bring major adoption concerns. Objective: We investigate the adoption concerns in two dominant open-source service mesh frameworks via a mixed-methods empirical investigation of the past, current and evolution of 5,497 practitioner questions posted on generic and framework-specific question-and-answer fora. Method: We first mine the topics of questions with the help of Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM). We identify evolution by applying topic modelling to time periods and aggregating topics into macro-topics. We conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the three major types of questions and to generalize common fix patterns for the extracted error symptoms. We consulted a service mesh domain expert to provide feedback on our findings and discuss implications. Results: We found that about half of the questions are error-related and mined 18 topics, covering service mesh traffic, infrastructure, security, observability and application. We discovered a drastic decline in traffic-related concerns while finding persisting infrastructure-related concerns and a rise in security and observability concerns. We identified 54 error symptoms from two popular service mesh frameworks and generalized 9 common fix patterns. We found complex symptom-to-fix relationships, yet, surprisingly, minimal configuration changes were able to fix most symptoms. Conclusion: Providing consistent documentation and practical automation that assists customization of service mesh deployment and functionalities is crucial in the current service mesh domain, given the diversity of discovered intentions, goals and symptoms. Furthermore, there should be more work towards better container orchestration to deploy service mesh frameworks and reliable customization of security and observability service mesh features. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Cloud-native systems have recently emerged as one of the most popular platforms for application development, providing lightweight virtualization, simplified DevOps procedures, scaling, resource efficiency, monitoring, and more. The typical cloud-native system may include containers, container orchestrators, and service meshes. However, a number of attacks exploit vulnerabilities in different components, leading the attacker to gain control over the cloud-native system. In this paper, we collect, classify, exploit, and mitigate vulnerabilities of different components. Firstly, we choose Docker, Kubernetes, and Istio as the most popular cloud technologies and give each an overview. Secondly, we give an in-depth analysis of the vulnerabilities. We collect cloud-native vulnerabilities over the past five years and propose two classifications of those vulnerabilities. One is based on the architecture of the component, and the other is based on the attack enabled. We exploit vulnerabilities that enable us to discover some insightful findings and provide mitigation solutions. Third, we analyze 15 open-source security tools provided for the cloud-native environment. We argue that among all these security tools, none of them covers all features which we will discuss in this paper. We believe that our analysis of cloud security vulnerabilities and open-source security tools can benefit the security of the cloud-native ecosystem. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In modern microservice architecture, the colocation of online and offline services is becoming increasingly prevalent. While the Istio service mesh, with its sidecar proxy model, facilitates the orchestration, monitoring, and security of microservices. However, the colocation of diverse workloads can lead to interference issue, affecting the performance and reliability of the system. This paper presents a novel interference detection mechanism tailored for colocation deployments on mesh sidecar clusters. Our approach leverages the robust observability and traffic control features provided by service mesh to monitor and analyze the behavior of services in real-time, identifying interference scenarios and their impact on service performance. We have carried out the colocation interference experiment, and the relevant metrics are collected and analyzed. In addition, we proposed an interference detection algorithm based on HBOS algorithm to classify experimental data. Experimental results show that our detection algorithm has a high accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Predictive maintenance is gradually replacing conventional preventive maintenance, through an informed decision-making process for a fleet operator to proactively monitor the health status of the sea-based equipment and machinery. As a result, the fleet operator will only need to ask for on-time repair and maintenance services instead of periodic maintenance, which saves both time and cost significantly. While moving into this new maritime business model, which is also known as Service-as-a-Product (SaaP), both fleet operators and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) companies could also build a stronger collaboration in the maritime industries. With the advent of digital transformation towards Industry 4.0 (I4.0), the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) renders the massive collection of operational and machinery process data from the vessel equipment through sensorization, where these collected real-time information are useful for advanced analytics to predict equipment failure and to avoid unplanned downtime. Unlike other industries, there are a few challenges in the maritime industries when developing a centralized smart vessel equipment monitoring platform. One of the key challenges, is the lack of a feasible data management system, requires the centralized host must be able to handle and manage the telemetry IoT data that is transmitted over the satellite communication, by complying with all cybersecurity considerations and regulations in maritime sector. In this paper, we present a scalable, hybrid cloud-based data management framework that can connect to multiple edge systems where each system is deployed on a physical vessel, to establish a scalable SaaP business model. Hence, the ship-to-shore sensorized data can be processed and monitored via a real-time visualization dashboard through the centralized cloud-based platform. We argue that our approach, would be a turn-key solution that can be implemented for mostly all types of marine equipment and machinery, and thus to further improve the prediction tools to support advanced decision-making techniques, such as optimal time repair of vessel equipment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Defining a scheduling and orchestration strategy for modern distributed microservices-based applications is a complex problem to deal with, especially if they are deployed on geo-distributed Cloud-to-Edge environments. Kubernetes is today the de-facto standard for container orchestration on Cloud data centers. However, its static container scheduling strategy is not suitable for the placement of complex and distributed microservices-based applications on Edge environments. Current infrastructure network conditions and resource availability neither run time application state are taken into account when scheduling microservices. To deal with these limitations in this work we present an extension of the Kubernetes platform in order to implement an effective application and infrastructure-aware container scheduling and orchestration strategy. In particular, we propose an extension of the default Kubernetes scheduler that considers application and infrastructure telemetry data when taking scheduling decisions. Furthermore, a descheduler component is also proposed that continuously tunes the application placement based on the ever changing application and infrastructure states. An evaluation of the proposed approach is presented by comparing it with the default Kubernetes scheduling strategy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={This paper envisages an agent-based approach for creating resilient, self-managing microservice systems. The approach is based on a categorisation of the adaptation space for microservices across two dimensions-Application/infrastructure and service-Type/composition. The monitoring and adaptation actions in the quadrants defined by these dimensions are distinct, requiring controllers/agents with different management capabilities. Based on this division of responsibility, an agent-oriented architectural approach is proposed-The Agent Mesh. A service mesh provides the observability and control of a network overlay that connects agents and services, while agents with the different capabilities defined above close the control loops at the application and infrastructure levels. A core feature of the approach is that both domain (managed) services and managing agents are integrated as microservices within the same mesh, and communicate with each other via sidecar proxies, thereby allowing adaptation of both the domain services and self-Adaptation of the agents. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={This keynote proposes the application of cloud native technologies to the information integration architecture of large cruise ships. Cloud native technologies enable organizations to build and run scalable applications in public, private and hybrid clouds. Features such as containers, service meshes and microservices illustrate this approach and enable the creation of loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable and observable. Service mesh from Istio provides a non-intrusive, cross-language service framework for use by cruise ships, and it realizes the communication between services through a sidecar model. It solves the problem of information integration between cruise ship business applications with different development languages, different technology stacks and different communication interfaces. The automated operation and maintenance platform uses Docker and Kubernetes technologies to reduce the need for maintenance. In addition, the keynote discusses how data integration and application integration development specifications enable baseline development of cruise applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Nowadays, cloud providers cannot serve applications with low latency requirements. It is possible to run applications closer to the user through Fog and Edge computing. This article presents an architecture capable of orchestrating applications across multi-clouds. We used a fake application composed of six microservices to measure its latency in five different scenarios. Tests showed that the orchestrator allowed connecting data centers in different regions. It was also possible for applications in different data centers to communicate directly through proxies and with security. We observed that in scenarios where part of the microservices ran only on Fog or Fog and Edge, there was lower latency than microservices running on the cloud. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
